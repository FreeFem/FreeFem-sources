Compiling FreeFem++ from CVS sources
------------------------------------

$Id$

To download a working copy from the CVS repository:

> export CVSROOT=:ext:<username>@hydre.ann.jussieu.fr:/home/lehyaric/FreeFem++-cvs
> export CVS_RSH=ssh
> cvs checkout freefem++

(this produces a directory named "freefem++" containing the most
recent version of all the source files)

To update all the makefiles and the "configure" script if
"configure.ac" has been modified:

> autoreconf

To compile, check and install FreeFem++:

> ./configure [--enable-debug] [other options found in README and INSTALL...]
> make
> make check
> make install

To update the contents of "changelog" (which lists all modified files
and the related commit messages):

> make changelog (needs "cvs2cl" to be installed on the machine)

To build an archive containing all the source files:

> make dist
