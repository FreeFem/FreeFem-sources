V2.1-1
 * correct mistake in simple integral computation (not in variationnal 
   form)  before we alway use a quadrature formula of order 3, 
   now we can change the quadrature formula and the defaut is of order 5. 
V2.0-4
 * change in mshptg the size of the small possible edge from
   1/32000 to 1/1 000 000 000, this mesher is use in trunc, 
  splitmesh, and triangulate functions.

V2.0-3
 * correct operator x =/,  it does  nothing before. (v2.0-3)
   see end  examples++-tutorial/array.edp for all array operator
   =  +  -  *  /  .*  ./ += -= /= *=  : .l1 .l2 .linfty .sum .max .min ' 
   
 * correct bug when solving complex linear system with UMFPACK
   before we solve the system when the conjugate matrix


Major Change previous version
-----------------------------
 * add ternary C expression
     Symbol       Example      Explanation
       ?:          a?b:c     ternary operation
 
 * add 
   sparse matrix computation,
   block matrix construction 
   interpolation construction
   see 
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-cmatrix.edp  
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-matrix.edp
     examples++-tutorial/mat_interpol.edp
   not so well tested, but could be worse. 
   
 * add example to solve vartionnal inequation. VI.edp

 * add  possibility to build matrix where the 3 meshes 
   the integrale mesh, unkwon FE mesh, test FE function 
   can be different.  You must use varf to build the matrix 
   is not a standard porblem.
  
 * Improvement of  dynamic loading facility under the 3 systems
   add a fast fourier transform with dynamic loading
   see examples++-load/dfft.edp
