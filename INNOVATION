v 2.11-1 (nov 28,2006)
  Correct bug in interpolation, we building fespace Wf(Th,[RT0,P0]); 
v 2.11 (nov 10,2006)
 Correction of  the problem in arpack (eigenvalue computation) under i383 processor.
 After 2 week of hard work, a found the bug.
 In new version of LAPACK second is a real function
 and in ARPACK second is a subroutine  (Thank the fortran).  
 So I change the Makefile to change the name of function second into secnd2. 
 How to find the bug, in this case the stack of the floatting register (info float under gdb) 
 are growing. So after any real function can return a NaN (one time) due to stack float register 
 overflow.  A big Thank to D. Bernardi of the help (Merci au fortran et Merci au i383).

v 2.10 (oct 26,  2006)
  correct problem with eigen value on window and some linux distrubition (Fedora)
  add a patch of two functions in lapack  see  arpack/arpack-patch-lapack.tar.gz

v 2.9 (sept 19, 2006 FH)

V2.8
   Correct mistake in OtherMacOsLib.tgz store file and not link (after 1 june)
 * Correct bug in vectorial problem with same approximation, some time
   we do a renumbering of the previous  approximation space (a pointer mistake).
V2.7-1
  * change size of data in 64 bits architecture (in file AnyType.hpp)
V2.7
  * correct mpi Makefile
  * correct bug in construction of recursive composite finite element (see HISTORY)
    remark: the finite elemnt struct, so all dynamic library must be recompile. 
V2.6-1
 * add the examples-bamg  directory  in freefem++ and  correct bamg graphic
V2.6
 * Huge work (more than a full week) to improve the windows version 
   change all the .dll construction
   remove lots of trap. All example run without graphics
V2.5.1
 *  change nbve= to nev= in EigenValue function  (to be compatible with the doc)
 *  newtow to newton    (to correct misspelling)
 *  change in AnyType to remove da randow bug on windows.
 *  vim color syntax from Richard MICHEL (vim_highlighting_for_FF++.tar.gz)

V2.5-0 
  *  add C++ string operator :  int i; string s = "....";
       i=s.length ; i=s.size; 
       i=s.find("qsdqs");i=s.rfind("sqs"); i=s.find("qsq",2); 
       s(3:4)="sdfffsf";  // replace from char 3 to 4 by 
       // s[3] not alloued to day (char type is not well type in freefem++).
       getline(cin,s); 
  *  Correct bug when passing parameter string in function
  *  add freefem++  mode for mi editor on macos http://www.mimikaki.net/en/
    store in  mode-mi-edp.zip archive (unzip and put in the Folder  openned with the 
    mi "Option->Open Mode Folder" menu and set "mi" is the Default application 
    for all the .edp file). 
    
V2.4-2
  * add lot missing vectorial operation with sub array 
  * if u is a complex array (i.e. complex[int u] ..;) 
     then  u.re (resp u.im) are  the real array of the real (resp. imag ) 
     part of the vector u
  * in block matrix add utilisation of array to build the block matrix
    see new Laplace-lagrange-mult.edp file to have an example
V2.3-3
 * add outer  product to set matrix or full real or complex 2D array
    A = 2*a*b'; // where A is a "real[int,int]", b and c a "real[int]".
    A += 2*a*b'; or  A = 2*a*b';
   add matrix and array renumbering (see sec. 4.8 of freefem++.doc for all details)

   a exception handling (no memory management.) 
   try {   code ; }
   catch (...) { code ; }
 * use tolpivot= to set the pivottol in LU, crout, cholesky factorization 
V2.2-1
 * Add init file to set verbosity, includepath  , loadpath and 
   add preload (dynamic link file)
   the file are under unix and MacOs
	 /etc/freefem++.pref
         /Users/hecht/.freefem++.pref
         freefem++.pref
   under windows
         freefem++.pref
   and the syntaxe of the files is

     verbosity= 5
     loadpath += "/Library/FreeFem++/lib"
     loadpath += "/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/lib"
     includepath  += "/Library/FreeFem++/edp"
     includepath  += "/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/edp"
     #  comment 
     load += "funcTemplate" 
     load += "myfunction" 

 * Add search directory for include, and load  under Unix and Windows
   Just on the shell sh  set environment variable
    export FF_VERBOSITY=50 
    export FF_INCLUDEPATH="dir;;dir2"
    export FF_LOADPATH="dir;;dir3""
   remark the separtor of directory  is ";" and not ":" because ":" is use under Windows.
 * Examples of Add new Finite element with dynamic link/load,  Morley and Bernardi Raugel   
   see examples++-load 
V2.1-2
 * add more example of dynamic load example (thank to F. Dortu)
 * correct mistake in simple integral computation (not in variationnal 
   form)  before we alway use a quadrature formula of order 3, 
   now we can change the quadrature formula and the defaut is of order 5. 
V2.0-4
 * change in mshptg the size of the small possible edge from
   1/32000 to 1/1 000 000 000, this mesher is use in trunc, 
  splitmesh, and triangulate functions.

V2.0-3
 * correct operator x =/,  it does  nothing before. (v2.0-3)
   see end  examples++-tutorial/array.edp for all array operator
   =  +  -  *  /  .*  ./ += -= /= *=  : .l1 .l2 .linfty .sum .max .min ' 
   
 * correct bug when solving complex linear system with UMFPACK
   before we solve the system when the conjugate matrix


Major Change previous version
-----------------------------
 * add ternary C expression
     Symbol       Example      Explanation
       ?:          a?b:c     ternary operation
 
 * add 
   sparse matrix computation,
   block matrix construction 
   interpolation construction
   see 
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-cmatrix.edp  
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-matrix.edp
     examples++-tutorial/mat_interpol.edp
   not so well tested, but could be worse. 
   
 * add example to solve vartionnal inequation. VI.edp

 * add  possibility to build matrix where the 3 meshes 
   the integrale mesh, unkwon FE mesh, test FE function 
   can be different.  You must use varf to build the matrix 
   is not a standard porblem.
  
 * Improvement of  dynamic loading facility under the 3 systems
   add a fast fourier transform with dynamic loading
   see examples++-load/dfft.edp
