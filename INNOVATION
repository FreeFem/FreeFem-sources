V2.2-1
 * Add init file to set verbosity, includepath  , loadpath and 
   add preload (dynamic link file)
   the file are under unix and MacOs
	 /etc/freefem++.pref
         /Users/hecht/.freefem++.pref
         freefem++.pref
   under windows
         freefem++.pref
   and the syntaxe of the files is

     verbosity= 5
     loadpath += "/Library/FreeFem++/lib"
     loadpath += "/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/lib"
     includepath  += "/Library/FreeFem++/edp"
     includepath  += "/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/edp"
     #  comment 
     load += "funcTemplate" 
     load += "myfunction" 

 * Add search directory for include, and load  under Unix and Windows
   Just on the shell sh  set environment variable
    export FF_VERBOSITY=50 
    export FF_INCLUDEPATH="dir;;dir2"
    export FF_LOADPATH="dir;;dir3""
   remark the separtor of directory  is ";" and not ":" because ":" is use under Windows.
 * Examples of Add new Finite element with dynamic link/load,  Morley and Bernardi Raugel   
   see examples++-load 
V2.1-2
 * add more example of dynamic load example (thank to F. Dortu)
 * correct mistake in simple integral computation (not in variationnal 
   form)  before we alway use a quadrature formula of order 3, 
   now we can change the quadrature formula and the defaut is of order 5. 
V2.0-4
 * change in mshptg the size of the small possible edge from
   1/32000 to 1/1 000 000 000, this mesher is use in trunc, 
  splitmesh, and triangulate functions.

V2.0-3
 * correct operator x =/,  it does  nothing before. (v2.0-3)
   see end  examples++-tutorial/array.edp for all array operator
   =  +  -  *  /  .*  ./ += -= /= *=  : .l1 .l2 .linfty .sum .max .min ' 
   
 * correct bug when solving complex linear system with UMFPACK
   before we solve the system when the conjugate matrix


Major Change previous version
-----------------------------
 * add ternary C expression
     Symbol       Example      Explanation
       ?:          a?b:c     ternary operation
 
 * add 
   sparse matrix computation,
   block matrix construction 
   interpolation construction
   see 
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-cmatrix.edp  
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-matrix.edp
     examples++-tutorial/mat_interpol.edp
   not so well tested, but could be worse. 
   
 * add example to solve vartionnal inequation. VI.edp

 * add  possibility to build matrix where the 3 meshes 
   the integrale mesh, unkwon FE mesh, test FE function 
   can be different.  You must use varf to build the matrix 
   is not a standard porblem.
  
 * Improvement of  dynamic loading facility under the 3 systems
   add a fast fourier transform with dynamic loading
   see examples++-load/dfft.edp
