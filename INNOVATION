Add version 2.0-0
   
 * if x is an array of type real[int], int[int] , complex[int]
   or a sub array then
   x.l2     is the l2 norm <=> sqrt(x'*x)
   x.l1     is the l1 norm
   x.linfty is the linfty norm
   
 * correct bug when solving complex linear system with UMFPACK
   before we solve the system when the conjugate matrix


Major Change previous version
-----------------------------

 * add Sparse matrix computation,
   block matrix construction 
   interpolation construction
   see 
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-cmatrix.edp  
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-matrix.edp
     examples++-tutorial/mat_interpol.edp
   not so well tested, but could be worse. 
   
 * add example to solve vartionnal inequation. VI.edp

 * add  possibility to build matrix where the 3 meshes 
   the integrale mesh, unkwon FE mesh, test FE function 
   can be different.  You must use varf to build the matrix 
   is not a standard porblem.
  
 * Improvement of  dynamic loading facility under the 3 systems
   add a fast fourier transform with dynamic loading
   see examples++-load/dfft.edp
