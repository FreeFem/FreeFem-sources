V2.8
   Correct mistake in OtherMacOsLib.tgz store file and not link (after 1 june)
 * Correct bug in vectorial problem with same approximation, some time
   we do a renumbering of the previous  approximation space (a pointer mistake).
V2.7-1
  * change size of data in 64 bits architecture (in file AnyType.hpp)
V2.7
  * correct mpi Makefile
  * correct bug in construction of recursive composite finite element (see HISTORY)
    remark: the finite elemnt struct, so all dynamic library must be recompile. 
V2.6-1
 * add the examples-bamg  directory  in freefem++ and  correct bamg graphic
V2.6
 * Huge work (more than a full week) to improve the windows version 
   change all the .dll construction
   remove lots of trap. All example run without graphics
V2.5.1
 *  change nbve= to nev= in EigenValue function  (to be compatible with the doc)
 *  newtow to newton    (to correct misspelling)
 *  change in AnyType to remove da randow bug on windows.
 *  vim color syntax from Richard MICHEL (vim_highlighting_for_FF++.tar.gz)

V2.5-0 
  *  add C++ string operator :  int i; string s = "....";
       i=s.length ; i=s.size; 
       i=s.find("qsdqs");i=s.rfind("sqs"); i=s.find("qsq",2); 
       s(3:4)="sdfffsf";  // replace from char 3 to 4 by 
       // s[3] not alloued to day (char type is not well type in freefem++).
       getline(cin,s); 
  *  Correct bug when passing parameter string in function
  *  add freefem++  mode for mi editor on macos http://www.mimikaki.net/en/
    store in  mode-mi-edp.zip archive (unzip and put in the Folder  openned with the 
    mi "Option->Open Mode Folder" menu and set "mi" is the Default application 
    for all the .edp file). 
    
V2.4-2
  * add lot missing vectorial operation with sub array 
  * if u is a complex array (i.e. complex[int u] ..;) 
     then  u.re (resp u.im) are  the real array of the real (resp. imag ) 
     part of the vector u
  * in block matrix add utilisation of array to build the block matrix
    see new Laplace-lagrange-mult.edp file to have an example
V2.3-3
 * add outer  product to set matrix or full real or complex 2D array
    A = 2*a*b'; // where A is a "real[int,int]", b and c a "real[int]".
    A += 2*a*b'; or  A = 2*a*b';
   add matrix and array renumbering (see sec. 4.8 of freefem++.doc for all details)
    
V2.3-0
 * add three key word for future use try,catch throw 
   a exception handling (no memory management.) 
   try {   code ; }
   catch (...) { code ; }
 * use tolpivot= to set the pivottol in LU, crout, cholesky factorization 
V2.2-1
 * Add init file to set verbosity, includepath  , loadpath and 
   add preload (dynamic link file)
   the file are under unix and MacOs
	 /etc/freefem++.pref
         /Users/hecht/.freefem++.pref
         freefem++.pref
   under windows
         freefem++.pref
   and the syntaxe of the files is

     verbosity= 5
     loadpath += "/Library/FreeFem++/lib"
     loadpath += "/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/lib"
     includepath  += "/Library/FreeFem++/edp"
     includepath  += "/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/edp"
     #  comment 
     load += "funcTemplate" 
     load += "myfunction" 

 * Add search directory for include, and load  under Unix and Windows
   Just on the shell sh  set environment variable
    export FF_VERBOSITY=50 
    export FF_INCLUDEPATH="dir;;dir2"
    export FF_LOADPATH="dir;;dir3""
   remark the separtor of directory  is ";" and not ":" because ":" is use under Windows.
 * Examples of Add new Finite element with dynamic link/load,  Morley and Bernardi Raugel   
   see examples++-load 
V2.1-2
 * add more example of dynamic load example (thank to F. Dortu)
 * correct mistake in simple integral computation (not in variationnal 
   form)  before we alway use a quadrature formula of order 3, 
   now we can change the quadrature formula and the defaut is of order 5. 
V2.0-4
 * change in mshptg the size of the small possible edge from
   1/32000 to 1/1 000 000 000, this mesher is use in trunc, 
  splitmesh, and triangulate functions.

V2.0-3
 * correct operator x =/,  it does  nothing before. (v2.0-3)
   see end  examples++-tutorial/array.edp for all array operator
   =  +  -  *  /  .*  ./ += -= /= *=  : .l1 .l2 .linfty .sum .max .min ' 
   
 * correct bug when solving complex linear system with UMFPACK
   before we solve the system when the conjugate matrix


Major Change previous version
-----------------------------
 * add ternary C expression
     Symbol       Example      Explanation
       ?:          a?b:c     ternary operation
 
 * add 
   sparse matrix computation,
   block matrix construction 
   interpolation construction
   see 
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-cmatrix.edp  
     examples++-tutorial/sparse-matrix.edp
     examples++-tutorial/mat_interpol.edp
   not so well tested, but could be worse. 
   
 * add example to solve vartionnal inequation. VI.edp

 * add  possibility to build matrix where the 3 meshes 
   the integrale mesh, unkwon FE mesh, test FE function 
   can be different.  You must use varf to build the matrix 
   is not a standard porblem.
  
 * Improvement of  dynamic loading facility under the 3 systems
   add a fast fourier transform with dynamic loading
   see examples++-load/dfft.edp
