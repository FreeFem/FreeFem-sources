Fruit of a long maturing process, freefem, in its last avatar, \texttt{FreeFem++}, is a high level integrated development environment (IDE)  for numerically solving partial differential equations (PDE) in dimension 2 and 3.  It is the ideal tool for teaching the finite element method but it is also perfect for research to quickly test new ideas or multi-physics and complex applications.


\medskip

\texttt{FreeFem++} has an advanced automatic mesh generator, capable of a posteriori mesh adaptation; it has a general purpose elliptic solver  interfaced with fast algorithms such as the multi-frontal method UMFPACK, SuperLU . Hyperbolic and parabolic problems are solved by iterative algorithms prescribed by the user with the high level language of \texttt{FreeFem++}. It has several triangular  finite elements, including discontinuous elements.  Finally everything is there in \texttt{FreeFem++} to prepare research quality reports: color display online with zooming and other features and postscript printouts.
\medskip

This manual is meant for students at Master level, for  researchers at any level, and for engineers (including financial engineering) with some understanding of variational methods for partial differential equations.

\section{Introduction}\pagenumbering{arabic} \setcounter{page}{1}
A partial differential equation is a relation between a function
of several variables and its (partial) derivatives.
 Many problems in physics, engineering, mathematics and even banking
are modeled by one or several partial differential equations.
\\\\
\freefempp is a software to solve these equations numerically. As
its name implies, it is a free software (see the copyrights for full detail)
based  on the Finite Element Method; it is not a package, it is an integrated product with its own
high level programming language. This software runs on all UNIX
OS (with g++ 3.3 or later, and X11R6) , on Window  XP, Vista and 7 and on
MacOS 10 (powerpc, intel) \\\\
Moreover \freefempp is highly adaptive.  Many phenomena involve
several  coupled systems, for example: fluid-structure interactions,
Lorentz forces for aluminium casting and ocean-atmosphere problems are
three such systems. These require different finite element approximations and polynomial
degrees, possibly on different meshes. Some algorithms like
Schwarz' domain decomposition method also require data interpolation
on multiple meshes within one program. \freefempp can handle these
difficulties, i.e. {\it arbitrary finite element spaces on arbitrary
unstructured and adapted bi-dimensional meshes}.  \\\\

The characteristics of \freefempp are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Problem description (real or complex valued) by their variational formulations,
with access to the internal vectors and matrices if needed.
%
\item Multi-variables, multi-equations, bi-dimensional and three-dimensional
 static or time dependent, linear or nonlinear
coupled systems; however the user is required to describe the
iterative procedures which reduce the problem to a set of linear
problems.
%
\item Easy geometric input by analytic description of boundaries by pieces;
however this part is not a CAD system; for instance when two
boundaries intersect, the user must specify the intersection points.
%
\item Automatic mesh generator, based on the Delaunay-Voronoi
algorithm; the inner point density is proportional to the density of
points on the boundaries \cite{George}.
%
\item Metric-based anisotropic mesh adaptation. The metric can be
computed automatically from the Hessian of any \freefempp function
\cite{bamg}.
%
\item High level user friendly typed input language with an algebra
of analytic and finite element functions.
%
\item  Multiple finite element meshes within one application with
automatic interpolation of data on different meshes and possible
storage of the interpolation matrices.
%
\item A large variety of triangular finite elements : linear, quadratic
 Lagrangian elements and more, discontinuous P1 and Raviart-Thomas elements,
 elements of a non-scalar type, the mini-element,\dots{} (but no quadrangles).
%
\index{mean}
\item Tools to define discontinuous Galerkin finite element formulations
\ttCC{P0},\ttCC{P1dc},\ttCC{P2dc} and keywords: \ttCC{jump}, \ttCC{mean}, \ttCC{intalledges}.
%
\item A large variety of linear direct and iterative solvers
(LU, Cholesky, Crout, CG, GMRES, UMFPACK, MUMPS, SuperLU, ...) and eigenvalue and
eigenvector solvers (ARPARK) .
%
\item Near optimal execution speed (compared with compiled C++
implementations programmed directly).

\item Online graphics, generation of \texttt{,.txt,.eps,.gnu, mesh} files
  for further manipulations of input and output data.
%
\item Many examples and tutorials: elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic problems,
 Navier-Stokes flows, elasticity, Fluid structure interactions,
Schwarz's domain decomposition method, eigenvalue problem, residual
error indicator, ...
%
\item A parallel version using \texttt{mpi}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation }
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{For everyone:}
 First open the following web page
 \begin{center}
  \url{http://www.freefem.org/ff++/}
 \end{center}

And choose your platform: Linux, Windows, MacOS X,
or go to the end of the page to get the full list of downloads.

\begin{remark}: Binaries are available for Microsoft Windows, Apple
Mac OS X and some Linux systems.
%"\texttt{FreeFem++}" at \url{http://www.freefem.org}.
\end{remark}
Install by double click on the appropriate file.


\paragraph{Windows binaries install}

  First download the windows installation executable, then double click it. to install \texttt{FreeFem++}. In most cases just answer yes (or typr return) to all questions. Otherwise in the Additional Task windows, check the  box "Add application directory to your system path your system path ." This is required otherwise the program  \texttt{ffglut.exe} will not be found.

  By now you should have
  two new icons on your desktop:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{FreeFem++ (VERSION).exe}  the  \freefempp application.
  % \item \texttt{FreeFem++ (VERSION) GUI.exe}  the GUI \freefempp application, see section \ref{GUI} for more information.
   \item \texttt{FreeFem++ (VERSION) Examples} a link to the \freefempp  folder of  examples.
  \end{itemize}
  where \texttt{(VERSION)} is the version of the files (for example \texttt{3.3-0-P4}).

 By default, the installed files are  in
  \begin{center}
  \verb!C:\Programs Files\FreeFem++!
  \end{center}
  In this directory, you have all the \texttt{.dll} files and
    other applications: \texttt{FreeFem++-nw.exe},\texttt{ffglut.exe}, ...  the \freefempp application
    without graphic windows.
\medskip


The syntax for the command-line tools are the same as those of FreeFem.exe.
%{ \small
%\begin{itemize}
%\item  \verb!FreeFem++.exe [-vnn] [-b] [-s] [-n] [-h] [-f]  [ filepath ]! where the
% \begin{description}
%\item \verb!-b!  no color (black and white plot)
%\item \verb!-n!  no edit
%\item \verb!-s!  not wait at end of execution
%\item \verb!-vnn!  set the level of verbosity to \texttt{nn} before execution of the  script.
%\item  if no file path then you get a dialog box to choose the edp file.
%\end{description}
%\item  \verb!FreeFem++-nw.exe [-v nn]   [[-f] filepath]!
%\end{itemize}}
%\medskip
% where the part in \texttt{[]} is optional.


\paragraph{MacOS X  binaries install}


  Download the MacOS X binary version file, extract all the files with a double click on the
  icon of the file, go the the directory and put the \texttt{FreeFem+.app} application in the
  \texttt{/Applications} directory.
  If you want a terminal access to \freefempp just copy the file \texttt{FreeFem++} in a
   directory of your \verb!$PATH! shell environment variable.

  If you want to automatically launch the \texttt{FreeFem++.app}, double click on a \texttt{.edp} file icon.
  Under the finder pick a \texttt{.edp} in directory \texttt{examples++-tutorial} for example,
  select menu  \texttt{File -> Get Info} an \texttt{change Open with:} (choose FreeFem++.app) and click on button
  \texttt{change All...}.



\paragraph{Where to go from here} An integrated environment called \texttt{FreeFem++-cs}, written by Antoine Le Hyaric,  is provided with \freefempp. Unless you wish to profile now your own development environment, you may proceed to  the next paragraph "How to use FreeFem++".

\subsubsection{For the pros: Installation from sources}

This section is for those who for some reason do not wish to use the binaries and hence need to recompile \freefempp or install it from the source code:

\paragraph{The documentation archive}: The documentation is also open source; to regenerate it you need a \LaTeX{} environment capable of compiling a CVS archive; under MS-Windows you will have to use  \texttt{mingw/msys}
\begin{center}
   \url{http://www.mingw.org}
\end{center}
 and under MacOS X we have used Apple's Developer Tools "Xcode" and  \LaTeX{ } from \url{http://www.ctan.org/system/mac/texmac}.

\paragraph{The C++  archive}:  \freefempp must be compiled  from the source archive, as indicated in \begin{center}
   \url{http://www.freefem.org/ff++/index.htm}
\end{center}
To
extract files from the compressed archive \texttt{freefem++-(VERSION).tar.gz}
to a directory called
\begin{center}
\texttt{freefem++-(VERSION)}
\end{center}
enter the following commands in a shell window~:

\bFF
tar zxvf freefem++-(VERSION).tar.gz
cd freefem++-(VERSION)
\eFF


To compile and install \freefempp, just follow the \texttt{INSTALL}
and \texttt{README} files. The following programs are produced,
depending on the system you are running :
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{FreeFem++}, standard version, with a graphical interface
based on GLUT/OpenGL (use ffglut visualization tool) or not just add \texttt{ -nw } parameter.
\item \texttt{ffglut} the visualization tools  through a pipe of freefem++ (remark: {\it if ffglut is not in the system path,
you will have no plot})
\item \texttt{FreeFem++-nw}, postscript plot output only and  ffmedit (batch version, no graphics windows via \texttt{ffglut} )
\item \texttt{FreeFem++-mpi}, parallel version, postscript output only 
%\item \texttt{FreeFem++-glx}, graphics using OpenGL and X11
%\item \texttt{FreeFem++-cs}, integrated development environment
%\item \texttt{FreeFem++-ag}, integrated development environment
%\item  Sorry, the integrated development environment is reconstruction with the new architecture
% (please see chapter Graphical User Interface \ref{GUI}  for more details).
\item \texttt{/Applications/FreeFem++.app}, the Drag and Drop CoCoa MacOSX
Application
%\item \texttt{FreeFem++-CoCoa}, MacOS Shell script for MacOS OpenGL
%version (MacOS 10.3 or better) (note: it uses
%/Applications/FreeFem++.app)
\item \texttt{bamg} , the bamg mesh generator
\item \texttt{cvmsh2} , a mesh file convertor
\item \texttt{drawbdmesh} , a mesh file viewer
\item \texttt{ffmedit} the freefem++ version of medit software (thanks to P. Frey)
\end{enumerate}

The syntax of tools \texttt{FreeFem++},\texttt{FreeFem++-nw},\texttt{FreeFem++-mpi}, on the command-line  are
{ \small
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb!FreeFem++ [-?] [-v nn] [-fglut file1] [-glut file2] [-f]  edpfilepath ! where the
\item or \verb!FreeFem++-nw -? [-v nn] [-fglut file1] [-glut file2] [-f]  edpfilepath ! where the
 \begin{description}
 \item \verb!-?!  show the usage.
\item \verb!-fglut filename!  to store all the data for graphic in file \verb! filename!, and to replay do
\verb!ffglut filename!.
\item \verb!-glut  ffglutprogam!  to change the visualisator program's.
\item \verb!-nw! no call to ffglut and medit 
\item \verb!-v nn!  set the level of verbosity to \texttt{nn} before execution of the  script.
\item \verb!-ne! no edp script output
\item \verb!-wait! wait an return in text window before  closing \texttt{FreeFem++}
\item \verb!-nowait! wait an return in text window before  closing \texttt{FreeFem++}
\item \verb!-ne! no edp script output
\item \verb!-cd! Change directory  to script dir (the script path must by global)
\item  if no file path then you get a dialog box to choose the edp file on windows systeme.
\end{description}
\end{itemize}}
\medskip
The notation \texttt{[]} means "optional".


%The FreeFem++ parameter command:
%{\small \begin{verbatim}
%Brochet-2:~ hecht$ FreeFem++
% Syntaxe:
%   FreeFem++ [ -v verbosity ] [ -fglut filepath ] [ -glut command ] [ -nw] [ -f] filename  
%        -v      verbosity : 0 -- 1000000 level of freefem output 
%        -fglut  filepath  : the file name of save all plots (replot with ffglut command ) 
%        -glut    command  : change the command  ffglut 
%        -gff     command  : change the command  ffglut   with  space quotting
%        -nowait           : nowait at the end on text window  ( 
%        -wait             : wait at the end on text window   
%        -nw               : no ffglut and no medit  (=> no graphics windows) 
%        -ne               : no edp script output
%        -cd               : Change directory  to script dir 
% with        default ffglut : ffglut
%\end{verbatim}
%}
\begin{remark} In most cases you can set the level of output (verbosity\index{verbosity}) to value \texttt{nn} by adding the parameters
\texttt{-v nn} on the command line.

\end{remark}

As an installation test, under unix:  go into the directory
\texttt{examples++-tutorial} and run \freefempp on the example script
\texttt{LaplaceP1.edp} with the command~:

\bFF
FreeFem++ LaplaceP1.edp
\eFF

If you are using \texttt{nedit} as your text editor,
do one time \verb!nedit -import edp.nedit! to have coloring syntax for your \ttCC{.edp}
files.


\paragraph{Link with other text editors}

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item[{Crimson}] {\bf Editor}
availble at \url{http://www.crimsoneditor.com/} and adapted as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Go to the \texttt{Tools/Preferences/File} association menu and add the .edp extension set

\item In the same panel in \texttt{Tools/User} Tools, add a \texttt{FreeFem++} item (1st line) with the path
to \texttt{freefem++.exe} on the second line and \texttt{\$(FilePath)} and \texttt{\$(FileDir)} on third and fourth lines.
Tick the 8.3 box.
\item for color syntax, extract file from \texttt{crimson-freefem.zip} and put files in the corresponding sub-folder of
 Crimson folder (\verb.C:\Program Files\Crimson Editor. ).
\end{itemize}

\item[winedt] for Windows : this is the best but it could be tricky to set up.  Download it from
\begin{center}
 \url{http://www.winedt.com}
 \end{center}
 this is a multipurpose text editor  with advanced features
such as syntax coloring; a macro is available on \url{www.freefem.org} to localize winedt to \freefempp
without disturbing the winedt functional mode for LateX, TeX, C, etc.  However winedt is not free
after the trial period.

\item[TeXnicCenter] for Windows: this is the easiest and will be the best once we find a volunteer
to program the color syntax.  Download it from
\begin{center}\url{http://www.texniccenter.org/}\end{center}
It is also an editor for TeX/LaTeX. It has a "`tool"' menu which can be configured to launch
\freefempp programs as in:
\begin{itemize}
\item Select the \texttt{Tools/Customize} item which will bring up a dialog box.
\item Select the  \texttt{Tools} tab and  create a new item: call it \texttt{freefem}.

\item in the 3 lines below,
 \begin{enumerate}
\item  search for \texttt{FreeFem++.exe}
\item select Main file with further option
 then Full path and click also on the \texttt{8.3 box}
 \item select main file full directory path with 8.3
 \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\item[nedit] on the Mac OS, Cygwin/Xfree and linux, to import the color syntax do

\verb!nedit -import edp.nedit!

 \item[Smultron] on the Mac, available at \url{http://smultron.sourceforge.net}. It comes ready with color syntax for .edp file.  To teach it to launch \freefempp files, do a "command B" (i.e. the menu Tools/Handle Command/new command) and create a command which does
 \begin{verbatim}
 /usr/local/bin/FreeFem++-CoCoa %%p
 \end{verbatim}

\subsection{How to use \freefempp}

%\paragraph{Under Windows with Graphic Interfaces}

%The executable \texttt{freefem++.exe} opens a dialog box for
%choosing the input file, then it executes the input file content and produces
%graphics and output files.
%\\\\
%You can create and modify \freefempp programs with your favorite text editor.
%\\\\
%An integrated environment (\freefempp GUI), written by A. Le Hyaric, is also included
%with the distribution. the application name is \texttt{FreeFem++-cs}; note however that
%the graphics display is slower in this mode.
%There are other ways to have an integrated environment. TeX users usually have
%an editor installed; if it is winedt or TeXnicCenter then these can
%be programmed to handle the edit-run-correct cycle of \freefempp with
%color syntax and automatic launch of freefem.  If you don't have one of these
%installed the easiest is to download the freeware \texttt{Crimson Editor}.
%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=15cm]{csSnapOld}
%\caption{ The 3 panels of the integrated environment \texttt{freefem++-cs}:
%to the top left one has the program (which can be edited?), on the top right the graphic output window, and the bottom pane displays text messages.
%}
%\end{center}
%\end{figure}
\paragraph{Under MacOS X with Graphic Interfaces}

To test  an \texttt{.edp} file, just drag and drop
the file icon  on the MacOS application icon  \texttt{FreeFem++.app}.
You can also launch this application and use the menu:  $\mathtt{File} \rightarrow \mathtt{Open}$.

One of the best ways however on the Mac is to use a text editor like \texttt{Smultron.app}
(see above).
\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=10cm]{mi.jpg}
   \caption{The 3 panels of the integrated environment built with the
\texttt{fraise Editor} with \freefempp in action. The Tools menu
has an item to launch \freefempp by a Ctrl+1 command.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{In Terminal mode}

Choose the type of application from \texttt{FreeFem++}, \texttt{FreeFem++-nw},  \texttt{FreeFem++-mpi}, \dots  according to your needs.  Add at least the path name; for example
\bFF
 FreeFem++ your-edp-file-path
\eFF

\subsection{Environment variables, and the init file}


\index{verbosity}\index{includepath}\index{loadpath}\index{load}\index{include}
 \texttt{FreeFem++} reads a user's init file named \ttCC{freefem++.pref}
 to initialize global variables:
   \texttt{verbosity}, \texttt{includepath}, \texttt{loadpath}.

\begin{remark} The variable \texttt{verbosity} changes the level of internal printing ($0$, nothing (unless there are syntax errors), $1$ few,  $10$  lots, etc. ...),
the default value is $2$.
\\
 The include files are searched from the \texttt{includepath} list and the load files
are searched from  \texttt{loadpath} list.
\end{remark}

 The syntax of the file  is:
\begin{verbatim}
     verbosity= 5
     loadpath += "/Library/FreeFem++/lib"
     loadpath += "/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/lib"
     includepath  += "/Library/FreeFem++/edp"
     includepath  += "/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/edp"
     #  comment
     load += "funcTemplate"
     load += "myfunction"
     load += "MUMPS_seq" 
\end{verbatim}

 The possible paths for this file  are
 \begin{itemize}
   \item under unix and MacOs
\begin{verbatim}
	 /etc/freefem++.pref
    $(HOME)/.freefem++.pref
    freefem++.pref
\end{verbatim}
  \item under windows
\begin{verbatim}
     freefem++.pref
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

We can also use shell environment variable to change verbosity and
the search rule before the init files.

\begin{verbatim}
    export FF_VERBOSITY=50
    export FF_INCLUDEPATH="dir;;dir2"
    export FF_LOADPATH="dir;;dir3""
\end{verbatim}

 Remark: the separator between directories must be ";" and not ":" because ":" is used under Windows.

 Remark, to show the list of init of \texttt{freefem++}, do
\begin{verbatim}
 export FF_VERBOSITY=100; ./FreeFem++-nw
 --  verbosity is set to 100
 insert init-files /etc/freefem++.pref $
...
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{History}

The project has evolved from \texttt{MacFem, PCfem}, written in
Pascal. The first C version lead to \texttt{freefem 3.4}; it offered
mesh adaptativity on a single mesh only.
\\\\
A thorough rewriting in C++ led to \texttt{freefem+}
(\texttt{freefem+ 1.2.10} was its last release), which included
interpolation over multiple meshes (functions defined on one mesh
can be used on any other mesh); this software is no longer
maintained but still in use because it handles a problem description
using the strong form of the PDEs. Implementing the interpolation
from one unstructured mesh to another was not easy because it had to
be fast and non-diffusive; for each point, one had to find the
containing triangle. This is one of the basic problems of
computational geometry (see Preparata \& Shamos\cite{Preparata} for
example). Doing it in a minimum number of operations was the
challenge. Our implementation is $O(n\log n)$ and based on a
quadtree.  This version also grew out of hand because of the
evolution of the template syntax in C++.
 \\\\
We have been working for a few years now on \freefempp, entirely
re-written again in C++ with a thorough usage of {\tt template} and
generic programming
for coupled systems of unknown size at compile time. Like all
versions of \texttt{freefem} it has a high level user friendly input
language which is not too far from the mathematical writing of the
problems.
\\\\

The freefem language allows for a quick specification of any partial
differential system of equations.  The language syntax of \freefempp
is the result of a new design which makes use of the STL \cite{cpp},
templates and \texttt{bison} for its implementation; more detail can
be found in \cite{FHcpp}.
  The outcome is a
versatile software in which any new finite element can be included
in a few hours; but a recompilation is then necessary.  Therefore
the library of finite elements available in \freefempp will grow
with the version number and with the number of users who program
more new elements. So far we have discontinuous $P_0$
elements,linear $P_1$ and quadratic $P_2$ Lagrangian elements,
discontinuous $P_1$ and Raviart-Thomas elements and a few others like bubble elements.


\section{Getting Started}
\label{sec:example}

To illustrate with an example,
let us explain how \freefempp solves
\textbf{Poisson}'s equation: \emph{for a given function $f(x,y)$, find a
function $u(x,y)$ satisfying}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:Poisson}
-\Delta u(x,y) &=& f(x,y)\quad \mbox{ for all }(x,y)\in\Omega,
 \\ \label{eqn:Dirichlet}
  u(x,y) &=& 0\quad \mbox{ for all }(x,y)\mbox{ on }\p\Omega,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\partial\Omega$ is the boundary of the bounded open set $\Omega\subset \R^2$
and  $ \Delta u = \frac{\p^2 u}{\p x^2 } + \frac{\p^2 u}{\p y^2}$.


The following is a \freefempp program which computes $u$ when
$f(x,y)=xy$  and $\Omega$ is the unit disk. The boundary
$C=\p\Omega$ is
$$
C=\{(x,y)|\; x=\cos(t),\, y=\sin(t),\, 0\le t\le 2\pi\}
$$

Note that in \freefempp the domain $\Omega$ is assumed to described by its boundary
that is on the left side of its boundary oriented by the parameter.
%
%By definition the domain is on the left side of the boundary
%oriented by the parameter $t$.
 As illustrated in Fig. \ref{firstU},
we can see the isovalue of $u$ by using \ttCC{@plot} (see line 13
below).
\twoplot[height=5cm]{firstTh}{firstU}{mesh \texttt{Th} by \texttt{build(C(50))}}{isovalue by \texttt{plot(u)}}


\index{clock}
\begin{example}\label{exm:first}~
\bFF
    // defining the boundary \hfilll
 1: @border C(t=0,2*@pi){@x=cos(t); @y=sin(t);}
    // the triangulated domain Th is on the left side of its boundary \hfilll
 2: @mesh Th = @buildmesh (C(50));
    // the finite element space defined over Th is called here Vh
 3; @fespace Vh(Th,@P1);
 4: Vh u,v;  // defines u and v as piecewise-P1 continuous functions
 5: @func f= x*y;  // definition of a called f function
 6: @real cpu=clock(); // get the clock in second
 7: @solve Poisson(u,v,@solver=LU) =  // defines the PDE
 8:    @int2d(Th)(@dx(u)*@dx(v) + @dy(u)*@dy(v))   //  bilinear part
 9:    - @int2d(Th)( f*v)          // right hand side
 10:    + @on(C,u=0)  ;  // Dirichlet boundary condition
 11: @plot(u);
 12: @cout << " CPU time = " << clock()-cpu << @endl;
\eFF
\end{example}
Note that the qualifier \texttt{solver=LU} is not required and by default a
multi-frontal LU would have been used. Note also that the lines
containing \texttt{clock} are equally not required. Finally note how
close to the mathematics \freefempp input language is. Line \texttt{8} and  \texttt{9}
correspond to the mathematical variational equation
\[
    \int_{T_h}(\frac{\p u}{\p x}\frac{\p v}{\p x}
    +\frac{\p u}{\p y}\frac{\p v}{\p
    y})\d x \d y
    =
   \int_{T_h}f v\d x\d y
\]
for all $v$ which are in the finite element space $V_h$ and zero on
the boundary $C$.
\paragraph{Exercise}:
Change P1 into P2 and run the program.


\subsubsection{FEM by \freefempp: how does it work?}
This first example shows how \freefempp executes  with no effort all
the usual steps required by the finite element method (FEM). Let us
go through them one by one.
\\\\
\textbf{1st line:} the boundary $\Gamma$ is described analytically
by a parametric equation for $x$ and for $y$. When
$\Gamma=\sum_{j=0}^J \Gamma_j$ then each curve $\Gamma_j$, must be
specified and crossings of $\Gamma_j$ are not allowed except at end
points .

The keyword ``label'' can be added to define a group
of boundaries for later use (boundary conditions for instance).
 Hence the circle could also have been described as two half circle with
 the same label:
 \bFF
@border Gamma1(t=0,@pi)   {@x=cos(t); @y=sin(t); @label=C}
@border Gamma2(t=@pi,2*@pi){@x=cos(t); @y=sin(t); @label=C}
 \eFF
Boundaries can be referred to  either by name (\ttCC{Gamma1} for example) or by label (\ttCC{C} here)
or even by its internal number here 1 for the first half circle and 2 for the second
(more examples are in \refSec{Meshing Examples}).
\\\\
\textbf{2nd line:} the triangulation $\mathcal{T}_h$ of $\Omega$ is
automatically generated  by \ttCC{@buildmesh(C(50))} using $50$
points on \ttCC{C} as in Fig. \ref{firstTh}.

The domain is assumed to be on the left side of the boundary which is implicitly
oriented by the parametrization. So an elliptic hole can be added by
 \bFF
 @border C(t=2*@pi,0){@x=0.1+0.3*cos(t); @y=0.5*sin(t);}
 \eFF
If by mistake one had written
 \bFF
 @border C(t=0,2*@pi){@x=0.1+0.3*cos(t); @y=0.5*sin(t);}
 \eFF
then the inside of the ellipse would be triangulated as well as the outside.

Automatic mesh generation is
based on the Delaunay-Voronoi algorithm. Refinement of the mesh are
done by increasing the number of points on $\Gamma$, for example,
\ttCC{@buildmesh(C(100))}, because inner vertices are determined
by the density of points on the boundary. Mesh adaptation can be performed also
against a given function \ttCC{f} by calling \ttCC{@adaptmesh(Th,f)}.

Now the name $\mathcal{T}_h$ (\texttt{Th} in \freefempp) refers to
the family $\{T_k\}_{k=1,\cdots,n_t}$ of triangles shown in figure \ref{firstTh}.
Traditionally  $h$ refers to the mesh size, $n_t$ to the number of
triangles in $\mathcal{T}_h$ and $n_v$ to the number of vertices, but it is seldom
that we will have to use them explicitly.
If $\Omega$ is not a polygonal domain, a ``skin'' remains between
the exact domain $\Omega$ and its approximation
$\Omega_h=\cup_{k=1}^{n_t}T_k$.
However, we notice that all corners of $\Gamma_h = \p\Omega_h$ are
on $\Gamma$.
\\\\
\textbf{3rd line:} A finite element space is, usually, a space of
polynomial functions on elements, triangles here only, with certain matching properties
at edges, vertices etc.  Here \ttCC{@fespace Vh(Th,P1)} defines $V_h$ to be the
space of continuous functions which are affine in $x,y$ on each triangle of $T_h$.  As it is a
linear vector space of finite dimension, basis can be found.
The canonical basis is made of functions, called the \index{hat function}\emph{hat functions}
$\phi_k$ which are continuous piecewise affine and are equal to 1 on one vertex and 0 on all others.
A typical hat function is shown on figure \ref{fig-hatFunction}
\footnote{
The easiest way to define $\phi_k$ is by making use of the \index{barycentric coordinates}
\emph{barycentric coordinates}
$\lambda_i(x,y),~i=1,2,3$ of a point $q=(x,y)\in T$, defined by
\[
    \sum_i\lambda_i=1,~~~\sum_i\lambda_i\vec q^i=\vec q
\]
where $q^i,~i=1,2,3$ are the 3 vertices of $T$.  Then it is easy to see that
the restriction of $\phi_k$ on $T$ is precisely $\lambda_k$.
}.
Then
\begin{equation}
V_h(\mathcal{T}_h,P_1)=\left\{w(x,y)\left|\;
w(x,y)=\sum_{k=1}^{M}w_k\phi_k(x,y),\, w_k\textrm{ are real numbers}\right.\right\}
\label{eq 2.3}\end{equation}
where $M$ is the dimension of $V_h$, i.e. the number of vertices.
The $w_k$ are called the \index{degree of freedom}\emph{degree of freedom} of $w$ and $M$ the number of
the degree of freedom.

are the vertices.

\\\\
\textbf{Step3: Setting the problem}
\\
\textbf{4th line:} \texttt{Vh u,v} declares that $u$ and $v$ are approximated as above,
namely
\begin{equation}\label{defu}
u(x,y)\simeq u_h(x,y)=\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} u_k\phi_k(x,y)
\end{equation}
\textbf{5th line:} the right hand side \ttCC{f} is defined analytically using the keyword
\ttCC{@func}.

\textbf{7th--9th lines:} defines the bilinear form of equation (\ref{eqn:Poisson}) and
its Dirichlet boundary conditions (\ref{eqn:Dirichlet}).
\\
This \emph{variational formulation} is derived by
multiplying (\ref{eqn:Poisson}) by $v(x,y)$ and integrating
the result over $\Omega$:
$$
-\int_{\Omega}v\Delta u \,\d x\d y = \int_{\Omega} vf\, \d x\d y
$$
Then, by Green's formula, the problem  is converted into finding $u$
such that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:weakform}
&&a(u,v) - \ell(f,v) = 0
\qquad \forall v \hbox{ satisfying $v=0$ on }\p\Omega.\\
&&\hbox{with }a(u,v)=\int_{\Omega}\nabla u\cdot \nabla v \,\d x\d y ,
\quad \ell(f,v)=\int_{\Omega}fv\, \d x\d y
\label{eqn:bilinear}
\end{eqnarray}
 In \freefempp
the \textbf{Poisson} problem can be  declared only as in
\bFF
  Vh u,v; @problem Poisson(u,v) =
\eFF
and solved later as in
\bFF
...
  Poisson; //   the problem is solved here
...
\eFF
or declared and solved at the same time as in
\begin{center}
\ttCC{Vh u,v; @solve Poisson(u,v) =@int(...}
\end{center}
and (\ref{eqn:weakform}) is written with \ttCC{@dx}(u) $=\p
u/\p x$, \ttCC{@dy}(u) $=\p u/\p y$ and
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\int_{\Omega}\nabla u\cdot \nabla v\, \d x\d y \longrightarrow
\ttCC{@int2d(Th)( @dx(u)*@dx(v) + @dy(u)*@dy(v) )}\\
&&\int_{\Omega}fv\, \d x\d y \longrightarrow
\ttCC{@int@2d(Th)( f*v )}\qquad
\textrm{(Notice here, $u$ is unused)}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
In \freefempp {\bf bilinear terms and linear terms should not be under the same integral}; indeed to construct the linear systems
 \freefempp finds out which integral contributes to the bilinear form by checking if both terms , the unknown (here \texttt{u}) and test functions (here \texttt{v}) are present.
 \\\\
\textbf{Step4: Solution and visualization}\\

\textbf{6th line:} The current time in seconds is stored into the real-valued variable \ttCC{cpu}.

\textbf{7th line} The problem is solved.

\textbf{11th line:} The visualization is done as illustrated in Fig. \ref{firstU}
(see \refSec{Plot} for zoom, postscript and other commands).

\textbf{12th line:} The computing time (not counting graphics) is written on the console
Notice the C++-like syntax; the user needs not study C++ for using \freefempp,
but it helps to guess what is allowed in the language.
\\\\
\textbf{Access to matrices and vectors}
\\
Internally \freefempp will solve a linear system of the type
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:Equation}
\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} A_{ij}u_j - F_i=0 ,\quad i=0,\cdots,M-1;\qquad
F_i=\int_{\Omega}f\phi_i\, \d x\d y
\end{eqnarray}
which is found by using (\ref{defu}) and replacing $v$ by $\phi_i$
in (\ref{eqn:weakform}).
And the Dirichlet conditions are implemented by penalty,
namely by setting $A_{ii}=10^{30}$  and
 $F_i=  10^{30}*0$ if $i$ is a boundary degree of freedom. Note, that the number $10^{30}$ is called \ttCC{tgv}
 (\emph{tr\`es grande valeur})
 and it is generally possible to change this value \index{solve!tgv=}, see the index item \texttt{solve!tgv=}.

\medskip\index{matrix}\index{varf}

The matrix $A=(A_{ij})$ is called \emph{stiffness matrix} \index{matrix!stiffness matrix}.


If the user wants to access $A$ directly he can do so
by using (see section \ref{matrix-varf} page \pageref{matrix-varf} for details)
\bFF
@varf a(u,v) = @int2d(Th)( @dx(u)*@dx(v) + @dy(u)*@dy(v))
               + @on(C,u=0) ;
@matrix A=a(Vh,Vh);  // stiffness matrix,
\eFF

The vector $F$ \index{[]@\verb=[]=}
in (\ref{eqn:Equation}) can also be constructed manually
\bFF
@varf l(unused,v) = @int2d(Th)(f*v)+@on(C,unused=0);
Vh F;  F[] = l(0,Vh); //  F[] is the vector associated to the function \texttt{F}
\eFF
The problem can then be solved by
\bFF
 u[]=A^-1*F[]; // u[] is the vector associated to the function u
\eFF
\begin{note}
  Here \ttCC{u} and \ttCC{F} are finite element function, and  \ttCC{u[]} and
  \ttCC{F[]} give  the array of value associated ( \ttCC{u[]}$\equiv (u_i)_{i=0,\dots,M-1}$ and
  \ttCC{F[]}$\equiv (F_i)_{i=0,\dots,M-1}$). So we have
   $$
   \mathtt{u}(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \mathtt{u[][}i\mathtt{]} \phi_i(x,y) ,
   \qquad \mathtt{F}(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \mathtt{F[][}i\mathtt{]} \phi_i(x,y)
   $$
   where $\phi_i, i=0...,,M-1$ are the basis functions of  \texttt{Vh} like in equation
   (\ref{eq 2.3}), and $M = \mathtt{Vh.ndof}$ is  the number of degree of freedom (i.e. the dimension of the space \texttt{Vh}).

\end{note}
The linear system (\ref{eqn:Equation}) is solved by \texttt{UMFPACK}
unless another option is mentioned specifically  as in
\begin{center}
\ttCC{Vh u,v; @problem Poisson(u,v,@solver=CG) = @int2d(...}
\end{center}
meaning that \texttt{Poisson} is declared only here and when it is called (by simply writing \texttt{Poisson;}~) then
 (\ref{eqn:Equation}) will be solved by the Conjugate Gradient method.

\subsubsection{Some Features of \freefempp}

The language of \freefempp is  typed, polymorphic and reentrant with macro generation (see
\ref{macro}).  Every variable must be typed and declared in a
statement each statement separated from the next by a semicolon ";".
The syntax is that of C++ by default augmented with something that is more akin
to \TeX.
 For the specialist, one key guideline is that \freefempp rarely generates an internal
 finite element  array;
 this was adopted for speed and
consequently \freefempp could be hard to beat in terms of execution speed, except
for the time lost in the interpretation of the language (which can be reduced by a systematic usage
of \texttt{varf} and matrices instead of \texttt{problem}.



\subsection{The Development Cycle: Edit--Run/Visualize--Revise}

An integrated environment is provided with \freefempp by A. Le Hyaric;
Many examples and tutorials are also given along with this documentation and it is best
to study them and learn by example.
Explanations for some of these examples are given in this documentation in the next chapter. If you are a
FEM beginner, you may also have to read a book on variational formulations.

The development cycle will have the following steps:
\begin{description}
\item[Modeling:] From strong forms of PDE to weak forms, one must know the variational formulation
to use \freefempp; one should also have an eye on the reusability of the variational
formulation so as to keep the same internal matrices; a typical example is the
time dependent heat equation with an implicit time scheme: the internal matrix can be factorized
only once and \freefempp can be taught to do so.

\item[Programming:] Write the code in \freefempp language using a text editor such as the one
provided in the integrated environment.

\item[Run:] Run the code (here written in file mycode.edp).
note that this can also be done in terminal mode by :

\texttt{\% FreeFem++ mycode.edp}


\item[Visualization:] Use the keyword \texttt{plot} to display functions while \freefempp is running.
Use the plot-parameter \texttt{wait=1} to stop the program at each plot. Use the
plot-parameter \texttt{ps="toto.eps"} to generate a postscript file to archive the results.

\item[Debugging:] A global variable "debug" (for example) can help as in
 \ttCC{@wait=@true} to \ttCC{@wait=@false}.
\bFF
@bool debug = true;
@border a(t=0,2*pi){ x=cos(t); y=sin(t);label=1;}
@border b(t=0,2*pi){ x=0.8+0.3*cos(t); y=0.3*sin(t);label=2;}
@plot(a(50)+b(-30),wait=debug); // plot the borders  to see the intersection
//  (so change (0.8 in 0.3 in b) then needs a mouse click
@mesh Th = buildmesh(a(50)+b(-30));
@plot(Th,wait=debug);  // plot Th then needs a mouse click
@fespace Vh(Th,P2);
Vh f = @sin(pi*x)*@cos(pi*y);
plot(f,wait=debug);  // plot the function f
Vh g = @sin(@pi*x + @cos(@pi*y));
@plot(g,wait=debug);  // plot the function g
\eFF
Changing debug to false will make the plots flow continuously;  watching the flow of graphs
on the screen (while drinking coffee) can then become a pleasant experience.

Error messages are displayed in the console window. They are not always very explicit because of the
template structure of the C++ code, (we did our best)!  Nevertheless they are displayed at the right place.
For example, if you forget parenthesis as in
\bFF
@bool debug = true;
@mesh Th = @square(10,10;
@plot(Th);
\eFF
then you will get the following message from \texttt{FreeFem++},
\bFF
    2 : mesh Th = square(10,10;
 Error line number 2, in file bb.edp, before  token ;
parse error
  current line = 2
Compile error : parse error
        line number :2, ;
error Compile error : parse error
        line number :2, ;
 code = 1

\eFF
If you use the same symbol twice as in
\bFF
@real aaa =1;
@real aaa;
\eFF
then you will get the message
\bFF
    2 : real aaa; The identifier aaa exists
          the existing type is <Pd>
          the new  type is <Pd>

\eFF
%Notice that the line number start from 0.
If you find that the program isn't doing what you want you may also use \ttCC{@cout}
to display in text format on the console window the value of variables, just as you would do in C++.

 The following example works:
\bFF
...;
@fespace Vh...; Vh u;...
cout<<u;...
@matrix A=a(Vh,Vh);...
cout<<A;
\eFF
Another trick is to \emph{comment in and out} by using the``\ttCC{//}'' as in C++.
For example
\bFF
@real aaa =1;
// real aaa;

\section{Learning by Examples}
This chapter is for those, like us, who don't like to read manuals. A number of simple examples
cover a good deal of the capacity of \freefempp and are self-explanatory.  For the modeling part
this chapter continues at Chapter 9 where some PDEes of physics, engineering and finance are studied
in greater depth.

\subsection{Membranes}
\paragraph{Summary} \emph{Here we shall learn how to solve a \x{Dirichlet} and/or
\x{mixed Dirichlet Neumann} problem for the \x{Laplace operator} with
application to the equilibrium of a \x{membrane} under load.  We shall
also check
the \x{accuracy} of the method and interface with other \x{graphics packages}.}\\\\

An elastic membrane $\Omega$ is attached to a planar rigid support
$\Gamma$, and a force $f(x) dx$ is exerted on each surface element
$\d{x}=\d{x}_1 \d{x}_2$. The vertical membrane displacement,
$\varphi(x)$, is  obtained by solving  Laplace's equation:
 $$
     -\Delta \varphi =f ~\hbox{~in~}~ \Omega.
 $$
As the membrane is fixed to its planar support, one has:
$$ \varphi |_{\Gamma }=0.$$
If the support wasn't planar but at an elevation $z(x_1,x_2)$ then
the boundary conditions would be of \x{non-homogeneous Dirichlet}
type.
$$ \varphi|_{\Gamma}=z.$$

If a part $\Gamma_2$ of the membrane border $\Gamma$ is not fixed to
the support but is left hanging, then due to the membrane's rigidity the angle with the
normal vector $n$ is zero; thus the boundary conditions are
$$
    \varphi|_{\Gamma_1}=z,~~~~\frac{\p\varphi}{\p n}|_{\Gamma_2}=0
$$
where $\Gamma_1=\Gamma-\Gamma_2$; recall that
 $\frac{\p\varphi}{\p n}=\n\varphi\cdot n$.
  Let us recall also that the Laplace operator
$\Delta$ is defined by:
 $$
    \Delta \varphi = {\p ^{2}\varphi \over \p x^{2}_{1} }
    + {\p ^{2}\varphi \over \p x_{2}^{2} }.
 $$
With such "mixed boundary conditions" the problem has a unique
solution (see (1987), Dautray-Lions (1988), Strang (1986) and
Raviart-Thomas (1983)); the easiest proof is to notice that
$\varphi$ is the state of least energy, i.e.
 $$
    E(\phi) =\min_{\varphi-z\in V} E(v) ,\quad \mbox{with} \quad E(v)=\int_\Omega(\frac12|\n v|^2-fv )
 $$
and where  $V$ is the subspace of the Sobolev space $H^1(\Omega)$ of
functions which have zero trace on $\Gamma_1$. Recall that
($x\in\R^d,~d=2$ here)
$$
    H^1(\Omega)=\{u\in L^2(\Omega)~:~\n u\in (L^2(\Omega))^d\}
$$
Calculus of variation shows that the minimum must satisfy, what is known as the \x{weak form}
of the PDE or its
\x{variational formulation}  (also known here as the theorem of virtual work)
$$
    \int_\Omega \n\varphi\cdot\n w = \int_\Omega f w\quad\forall w\in V
$$
Next an integration by parts (Green's formula) will show that this is equivalent to
the PDE when second derivatives exist.

\paragraph{WARNING}
Unlike \texttt{freefem+} which had both weak and strong forms, \freefempp implements only
weak formulations.  It is not possible to go further in using this software if you don't know
the weak form (i.e. variational formulation) of your problem: either you read a book, or
ask help form a colleague or drop the matter.  Now if you want to solve a system of PDE
like $A(u,v)=0,~ B(u,v)=0$ don't close this manual, because in weak form it is
$$
    \int_\Omega(A(u,v)w_1+B(u,v)w_2)=0~~\forall w_1,w_2...
$$

\paragraph{Example}

Let an ellipse have the length of the semimajor axis $a=2$, and unitary the semiminor axis
Let the surface force be $f=1$. Programming this case with
\freefempp gives:
%
\begin{example}[membrane.edp]
\bFF
// file membrane.edp
@real theta=4.*pi/3.;
@real a=2.,b=1.; // the length of the semimajor axis and  semiminor axis
@func z=x;

@border Gamma1(t=0,theta)    { x = a * cos(t); y = b*sin(t); }
@border Gamma2(t=theta,2*pi) { x = a * cos(t); y = b*sin(t); }
@mesh Th=@buildmesh(Gamma1(100)+Gamma2(50));

@fespace Vh(Th,P2); // P2 conforming triangular FEM
Vh phi,w, f=1;

@solve Laplace(phi,w)=int2d(Th)(dx(phi)*dx(w) + dy(phi)*dy(w))
                - int2d(Th)(f*w) + on(Gamma1,phi=z);
@plot(phi,wait=true, ps="membrane.eps"); //Plot phi
@plot(Th,wait=true, ps="membraneTh.eps"); //Plot Th

savemesh(Th,"Th.msh");
\eFF
\end{example}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}

\caption{\label{figmembrane} Mesh and level lines of the membrane deformation. Below: the same in 3D

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\index{buildmesh}
A triangulation is built by the keyword \ttCC{buildmesh}. This keyword
calls a triangulation subroutine based on the Delaunay test, which
first triangulates with only the boundary points, then adds internal
points by subdividing the edges. How fine  the triangulation becomes is controlled
by the size of the closest boundary edges.

\medskip

The PDE is then discretized using the triangular second order finite
element method on the triangulation; as was briefly indicated in the previous chapter,
a linear system is derived from the discrete formulation whose size is the number of vertices
plus the number of mid-edges in
the triangulation. The system is solved by a multi-frontal Gauss LU factorization
implemented in the package \texttt{UMFPACK}. The keyword plot will display both
$\T_h$ and $\varphi$ (remove \texttt{Th} if $\varphi$ only is desired) and the
qualifier \texttt{fill=true} replaces the default option (colored level lines) by a full color display.
Results are on figure \ref{figmembrane}.

\bFF
@plot(phi,wait=true,fill=true); //Plot phi with full color display
\eFF

Next we would like to check the results!
\\
One simple way is to adjust the parameters so as to know the solutions.  For instance
on the unit circle \texttt{a=1} , $\varphi_e=\sin(x^2+y^2-1)$ solves the problem when
\[
    z=0,~f=-4(\cos(x^2+y^2-1)-(x^2+y^2)\sin(x^2+y^2-1))
\]
except that on $\Gamma_2$ $\p_n\varphi=2$ instead of zero.  So we will consider
a non-homogeneous Neumann condition and solve
$$
    \int_\Omega(\n\varphi\cdot\n w = \int_\Omega f w+\int_{\Gamma_2}2w\quad\forall w\in V
$$
We will do that with two triangulations, compute the $L^2$ error:
\[
\epsilon = \int_\Omega|\varphi-\varphi_e|^2
\]
and print the error in both cases as well as the log of their ratio an indication of
the rate of convergence.
\begin{example}[membranerror.edp]\label{membran}
\bFF
// file membranerror.edp
verbosity =0; // to remove all default output
@real theta=4.*pi/3.;
@real a=1.,b=1.; // the length of the semimajor axis and  semiminor axis
@border Gamma1(t=0,theta)    { x = a * cos(t); y = b*sin(t); }
@border Gamma2(t=theta,2*pi) { x = a * cos(t); y = b*sin(t); }

@func f=-4*(cos(x^2+y^2-1) -(x^2+y^2)*sin(x^2+y^2-1));
@func phiexact=sin(x^2+y^2-1);

@real[int] L2error(2);  // an array two values
@for(@int n=0;n<2;n++)
{
  @mesh Th=buildmesh(Gamma1(20*(n+1))+Gamma2(10*(n+1)));
  @fespace Vh(Th,P2);
   Vh phi,w;

  @solve laplace(phi,w)=int2d(Th)(dx(phi)*dx(w) + dy(phi)*dy(w))
    - int2d(Th)(f*w) - int1d(Th,Gamma2)(2*w)+ on(Gamma1,phi=0);
  @plot(Th,phi,wait=true,ps="membrane.eps"); //Plot Th and phi

  L2error[n]= sqrt(int2d(Th)((phi-phiexact)^2));
}

@for(int n=0;n<2;n++)
 @cout << " L2error " << n << " = "<<  L2error[n] <<endl;

@cout <<" convergence rate = "<< log(L2error[0]/L2error[1])/log(2.)  <<endl;

\eFF
\end{example}

the output is
\bFF

 L2error 0 = 0.00462991
 L2error 1 = 0.00117128
 convergence rate = 1.9829
times: compile 0.02s, execution 6.94s
\eFF

We find a rate of $1.93591$, which is not close enough to the $3$ predicted by the theory.
The Geometry is always a polygon so we lose one order due to the geometry approximation in $O(h^2)$

%\paragraph{Quiz} Why is it not 3? (hint: this is not due to \freefempp, but to the theory itself).
%\\\\

\medskip
Now if you are not satisfied with the \texttt{.eps} plot generated by \freefempp and you want to use other graphic
facilities, then you must store the solution in a file very much like in \texttt{C++}. It will be useless
if you don't save the triangulation as well, consequently you must do
\bFF
     {
       @ofstream ff("phi.txt");
       ff << phi[];
      }
    @savemesh(Th,"Th.msh");
\eFF
For the triangulation the name is important: it is the extension that determines the format.
\\
Still that may not take you where you want. Here is an interface with gnuplot to produce the
right part of figure \ref{membran}.
\bFF
// to build a gnuplot data file
{ @ofstream ff("graph.txt");
   @for (@int i=0;i<Th.nt;i++)
   { @for (@int j=0; j <3; j++)
       ff<<Th[i][j].x  << "    "<< Th[i][j].y<< "  "<<phi[][Vh(i,j)]<<@endl;
    ff<<Th[i][0].x  << "    "<< Th[i][0].y<< "  "<<phi[][Vh(i,0)]<<"\n\n\n"
   }
}
\eFF
We use the finite element numbering, where \ttCC{Wh(i,j)} is the global index of
$j^{Th}$  degrees of freedom of triangle number $i$.

Then open \texttt{gnuplot} and do
\bFF
        set palette rgbformulae 30,31,32
        splot "graph.txt" w l pal
\eFF
This works with \ttCC{P2} and \ttCC{P1}, but not with \ttCC{P1nc}
because the 3 first degrees of freedom  of  \ttCC{P2} or \ttCC{P2} are on vertices
and not with \ttCC{P1nc}.




\subsection{Heat Exchanger}

\paragraph{Summary}\emph{ Here we shall learn more about \x{geometry input }and
\x{triangulation files, as well as read and write} operations.}

\paragraph{The problem}
Let $\{C_{i}\}_{1,2} $, be  2 thermal conductors within an enclosure
$C_0$.
The first one is held at a constant temperature ${u} _{1} $ the other one has a given thermal
conductivity $\kappa_2$ 5 times larger than the one of $C_0$.
We assume that the border of enclosure $C_0$ is held at temperature $20^\circ C$ and that
we have waited long enough for thermal equilibrium.

In order to know ${u} (x) $ at any point $x$ of the domain
$\Omega$, we must solve \\
 $$
 \n\cdot(\kappa\n{u})  =0 ~~ \hbox{ in }~\Omega,
 \quad {u}_{|\Gamma} =g
  $$
where $\Omega$ is the interior of $C_0$ minus the conductors $C_1$
and $\Gamma$ is the boundary of $\Omega$, that is $C_0\cup C_1 $
Here $g$ is any function of $x$ equal to  ${u}_i$ on $C_i$.
The second equation is a reduced form for: \\
$$
  {u} ={u} _{i}   \hbox{   on  }   ~~~C_{i}, \quad i=0,1.
$$
The variational formulation for this problem is in the subspace $H^1_0(\Omega)
\subset H^1(\Omega)$ of functions which have zero traces on $\Gamma$.
\[
    u-g\in H^1_0(\Omega)~:~\int_\Omega\n u\n v =0~~~\forall v\in H^1_0(\Omega)
\]
Let us assume that $C_0$ is a circle of radius 5 centered at the origin,
% N=2 the number of exchanger ,
 $C_i$ are
rectangles, $C_1$ being at the constant temperature $u_1=60^\circ C$.


%The mesh can be made by the following \freefempp script:

\begin{example}[heatex.edp]
\bFF
// file heatex.edp
@int C1=99, C2=98; // could be anything such that $\ne 0$ and $ C1 \ne C2$
@border C0(t=0,2*pi){x=5*cos(t); y=5*sin(t);}

@border C11(t=0,1){ x=1+t;  y=3;      label=C1;}
@border C12(t=0,1){ x=2;    y=3-6*t;  label=C1;}
@border C13(t=0,1){ x=2-t;  y=-3;     label=C1;}
@border C14(t=0,1){ x=1;    y=-3+6*t; label=C1;}

@border C21(t=0,1){ x=-2+t; y=3;      label=C2;}
@border C22(t=0,1){ x=-1;   y=3-6*t;  label=C2;}
@border C23(t=0,1){ x=-1-t; y=-3;     label=C2;}
@border C24(t=0,1){ x=-2;   y=-3+6*t; label=C2;}

@plot(    C0(50)            // to see the border of the domain
        + C11(5)+C12(20)+C13(5)+C14(20)
        + C21(-5)+C22(-20)+C23(-5)+C24(-20),
        wait=true, ps="heatexb.eps");

@mesh Th=@buildmesh(    C0(50)
                    + C11(5)+C12(20)+C13(5)+C14(20)
                    + C21(-5)+C22(-20)+C23(-5)+C24(-20));
@plot(Th,wait=1);

@fespace Vh(Th,P1); Vh u,v;
Vh kappa=1+2*(x<-1)*(x>-2)*(y<3)*(y>-3);
@solve a(u,v)= @int2d(Th)(kappa*(@dx(u)*@dx(v)+@dy(u)*@dy(v)))
                +@on(C0,u=20)+@on(C1,u=60);
@plot(u,wait=true, value=true, fill=true, ps="heatex.eps");
\eFF
\end{example}

Note the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{C0} is oriented counterclockwise by $t$, while   \texttt{C1} is oriented clockwise
     and \texttt{C2} is oriented counterclockwise.
    This is why \texttt{C1} is viewed as a hole by {\tt buildmesh}.
%
\item \texttt{C1} and \texttt{C2} are built by joining pieces of straight lines.  To group them in the
    same logical unit to input the boundary conditions in a readable way we
    assigned a \x{label on the boundaries}.  As said earlier, borders
    have an internal number corresponding to their order in the program (check it by
    adding a {\tt cout<<C22;} above). This is essential to understand how a mesh can be
    output to a file and re-read (see below).
%
\item As usual the mesh density is controlled by the number of vertices assigned to each
    boundary. It is not possible to change the (uniform) distribution of vertices but a
    piece of boundary can always be cut in two or more parts, for instance \texttt{C12} could be
    replaced by \texttt{C121+C122}:

\bFF
 //    border C12(t=0,1){ x=2;    y=3-6*t;   label=C1;}
    @border C121(t=0,0.7){ x=2;    y=3-6*t;  label=C1;}
    @border C122(t=0.7,1){ x=2;    y=3-6*t;  label=C1;}
    ... @buildmesh(.../* C12(20) */ + C121(12)+C122(8)+...);
\eFF
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{heatexTh}~~~
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{heatex}
\caption{\label{figheatex} The heat exchanger}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Exercise} Use the symmetry of the problem with respect to the axes;
triangulate only one half of the domain, and set \x{Dirichlet}
conditions on the vertical axis, and Neumann conditions on the
horizontal axis.%\fin

\bigskip

\paragraph{Writing and reading triangulation files}
Suppose that at the end of the previous program we added the line
\bFF
savemesh(Th,"condensor.msh");
\eFF
and then later on we write a similar program but we wish to read the mesh from that
file. Then this is how the condenser should be computed:
\bFF
@mesh Sh=@readmesh("condensor.msh");
fespace Wh(Sh,P1); Wh us,vs;
@solve b(us,vs)= @int2d(Sh)(@dx(us)*@dx(vs)+@dy(us)*@dy(vs))
                +@on(1,us=0)+@on(99,us=1)+@on(98,us=-1);
@plot(us);
\eFF
Note that the names of the boundaries are lost but either their internal number
(in the case of \texttt{C0}) or their label number (for \texttt{C1} and \texttt{C2}) are kept.


 \subsection{Acoustics}

\paragraph{Summary}
\emph{Here we go to grip with \x{ill posed problems} and \x{eigenvalue problems}}

Pressure variations in air at rest are governed by the wave equation:
\[
     {\p^2 u \over \p t^2} - c^2 \Delta u =0.
\]
When the solution wave is monochromatic (and that depend on the boundary and initial conditions),
 $u$ is of the form
$u(x,t)=Re(v(x) e^{ik t})$ where $v$ is a solution of Helmholtz's equation:
%
\begin{eqnarray}&&
 k ^{2}v  + c^{2}\Delta v  =0 ~\hbox{~in~}~~\Omega,
 \cr&&
 \frac{\p v}{\p n}|_\Gamma=g.
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $g$ is the source.
Note the ``+'' sign in front of the Laplace operator and that $k>0$ is real. This sign may make the
problem ill posed for some values of $\frac c k$, a phenomenon called
 ``resonance''.\\
At resonance there are non-zero solutions even when $g=0$. So the following program may or may not work:

\begin{example}[sound.edp]
\bFF
// file sound.edp
@real kc2=1;
@func g=y*(1-y);

@border a0(t=0,1) { x= 5; y= 1+2*t ;}
@border a1(t=0,1) { x=5-2*t; y= 3 ;}
@border a2(t=0,1) { x= 3-2*t; y=3-2*t ;}
@border a3(t=0,1) { x= 1-t; y= 1 ;}
@border a4(t=0,1) { x= 0; y= 1-t ;}
@border a5(t=0,1) { x= t; y= 0  ;}
@border a6(t=0,1) { x= 1+4*t; y= t ;}

@mesh Th=@buildmesh( a0(20) + a1(20) + a2(20)
        + a3(20) + a4(20) + a5(20) + a6(20));
@fespace Vh(Th,P1);
Vh u,v;

solve sound(u,v)=@int2d(Th)(u*v * kc2 - @dx(u)*@dx(v) - @dy(u)*@dy(v))
                 - @int1d(Th,a4)(g*v);
@plot(u, wait=1, ps="sound.eps");
\eFF
\end{example}

Results are on Figure \ref{figsound}.  But when $kc2$ is an eigenvalue of the problem, then the
solution is not unique:
%%%ALH- \nequiv not available when package txfonts is disabled
if $u_e \neq 0$ is an eigen state, then for any given solution $u+u_e$ is another  a solution.
%$u_e$ the eigen state, "u" a solution $\Rightarrow$ $u+u_e$ is also a solution.
To find all the $u_e$ one can do the following
\bFF
@real sigma = 20;  // value of the shift
// OP = A - sigma B ;  //  the shifted matrix
@varf  op(u1,u2)= @int2d(Th)(  @dx(u1)*@dx(u2) + @dy(u1)*@dy(u2) - sigma* u1*u2 );
@varf b([u1],[u2]) = @int2d(Th)( u1*u2 ) ;//no Boundary condition see note \ref{note BC EV}

@matrix OP= op(Vh,Vh,solver=Crout,factorize=1);
@matrix B= b(Vh,Vh,solver=CG,eps=1e-20);

@int nev=2;  // number of requested eigenvalues near sigma

@real[int] ev(nev); // to store the  nev eigenvalue
Vh[int] eV(nev);   // to store the nev eigenvector

@int k=EigenValue(OP,B,sym=true,sigma=sigma,value=ev,vector=eV,
                   tol=1e-10,maxit=0,ncv=0);
@cout<<ev(0)<<" 2 eigen values "<<ev(1)<<endl;
v=eV[0];
@plot(v,wait=1,ps="eigen.eps");

\subsection{Thermal Conduction}
\label{ss Thermal Conduction}
\paragraph{Summary}\emph{ Here we shall learn how to deal with a \x{
time dependent} \x{parabolic} problem. We shall also show how to treat an
\x{axisymmetric} problem  and show also how to deal with a \x{nonlinear problem}.}

\paragraph{How air cools a plate}

We seek the temperature distribution in a plate $(0,Lx)\times(0,Ly)\times(0,Lz)$
of rectangular cross section $\Omega=(0,6)\times(0,1)$; the plate is
surrounded by air at temperature $u_e$ and
initially at temperature $u=u_0+\frac x L u_1$. In the plane perpendicular to the plate
at $z=Lz/2$,  the temperature varies little with
the coordinate $z$; as a first approximation the problem is 2D.
\\\\
We must solve the temperature equation in $\Omega$ in a time interval (0,T).
\begin{eqnarray}&&
    \p_t u -\n\cdot(\kappa\n u)=0 \hbox{ in } \Omega\times(0,T),
    \cr&&
    u(x,y,0)=u_0+x u_1
    \cr&&
    \kappa\frac{\p u}{\p n} +\alpha(u-u_e)=0\hbox{ on } \Gamma\times(0,T).
\end{eqnarray}
Here the diffusion $\kappa$ will take two values, one below the middle horizontal line and ten times less
above, so as to simulate a thermostat.
The term $\alpha(u-u_e)$ accounts for the loss of temperature by convection in air.  Mathematically
this boundary condition is of \x{Fourier} (or \x{Robin}, or \x{mixed}) type.
\\
The variational formulation is  in $L^2(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$; in loose terms and after applying an implicit Euler
finite difference approximation in time; we shall seek $u^n(x,y)$ satisfying for all $w\in H^1(\Omega)$:
\[
    \int_\Omega(\frac{u^n-u^{n-1}}{\delta t} w + \kappa\n u^n\n w) +\int_\Gamma\alpha(u^n-u_ue)w=0
\]

Notice that we must separate by hand the bilinear part from the linear one.

Notice also that  the way we store the temperature at point (3,0.5) for all times in file {\tt thermic.dat}.
Should a one dimensional plot be required, the same procedure can be used.  For instance to
print $x\mapsto \frac{\p u}{\p y}(x,0.9)$ one would do
\bFF
@for(@int i=0;i<20;i++) @cout<<@dy(u)(6.0*i/20.0,0.9)<<@endl;
\eFF
Results are shown on Figure \ref{figthermic}.

\subsubsection{Axisymmetry: 3D Rod with circular section}

Let us now deal with a cylindrical rod instead of a flat plate.  For simplicity we take $\kappa=1$.
In cylindrical coordinates, the Laplace
operator becomes ($r$ is the distance to the axis, $z$ is the distance along the
axis, $\theta$ polar angle in a fixed plane perpendicular to the axis):

$$ \Delta u = {1\over r}\p _r(r\p _r u) + {1\over r^2}\p ^2_{\theta\theta} u
 + \p ^2_{z z}.
$$

Symmetry implies that we loose the dependence with respect to
$\theta$; so the domain $\Omega$ is again a rectangle $]0,R[\times]0,|[$ . We take the convention of
numbering of the edges as in {\tt square()} (1 for the bottom horizontal ...);
the problem is now:

\begin{eqnarray}&&
r\p_t u-\p _r(r\p _r u) - \p _z(r\p _z u) = 0 \hbox{ in } \Omega,
\cr&&
u(t=0) = u_0 + \frac z{L_z} (u_1-u)
\cr&&
u|_{\Gamma_4} = u_0,\quad  u|_{\Gamma_2} = u_1,
\quad \alpha(u-u_e) + {\p u\over \p n} |_{\Gamma_1\cup\Gamma_3} = 0.
\end{eqnarray}
Note that the PDE has been multiplied by $r$.

After discretization in time with an implicit scheme, with time steps \texttt{dt},
in the \freefempp syntax $r$ becomes $x$ and $z$ becomes $y$ and the problem is:
\bFF
@problem thermaxi(u,v)=@int2d(Th)((u*v/dt + @dx(u)*@dx(v) + @dy(u)*@dy(v))*x)
                + @int1d(Th,3)(alpha*x*u*v) - @int1d(Th,3)(alpha*x*ue*v)
                - @int2d(Th)(uold*v*x/dt) + @on(2,4,u=u0);
\eFF
Notice that the bilinear form degenerates at $x=0$. Still one can prove existence and uniqueness
for $u$ and because of this degeneracy no boundary conditions need to be imposed on $\Gamma_1$.

\subsubsection{A Nonlinear Problem : Radiation}

Heat loss through \x{radiation}  is a loss proportional
to the absolute temperature to the fourth power (Stefan's Law). This adds to the
loss by convection and gives the following
boundary condition:
 $$\kappa{\p u\over \p n} +\alpha(u-u_e) + c[(u + 273)^4 - (u_e+273)^4] = 0$$

The problem is \x{nonlinear}, and must be solved iteratively. If $m$
denotes the iteration index, a semi-linearization of the radiation condition gives
$${\p u^{m+1}\over \p n} + \alpha(u^{m+1}-u_e)+ c(u^{m+1}-u_e)
(u^m+u_e +546) ((u^m + 273)^2 + (u_e+273)^2)  = 0,
$$
because we have the identity
$ a^4 - b^4 = (a-b)(a+b)(a^2+b^2)$.
The iterative process will work with $v=u-u_e$.

\subsection{Irrotational Fan Blade Flow and Thermal effects}

\paragraph{Summary}\emph{Here we will learn how to deal with a \x{multi-physics system}
of PDEs on a \x{Complex geometry,} with \x{multiple meshes} within one problem.  We
also learn how to manipulate the \x{region indicator} and see how smooth is the projection
operator from one mesh to another.}

 \paragraph{Incompressible flow}

Without viscosity and vorticity incompressible flows have a velocity given by:
 $$
 u=\left(\begin{matrix}{\p \psi \over \p x_{2} }\\ -{\p \psi
 \over \p x_{1}} \end{matrix}\right), \quad
  \hbox{  where $\psi  $ is solution of }\quad  \Delta \psi =0
$$
This equation expresses both incompressibility
 ($\nabla\cdot u=0$) and absence of vortex ($\nabla\times u =0$).

As the fluid slips along the walls, normal velocity is zero, which
means that $\psi$ satisfies:
$$
 \psi \hbox{ constant on the walls}.
$$
One can also prescribe the normal velocity at an artificial boundary, and this translates into
 non constant {Dirichlet} data for $\psi$.
\\\\

\paragraph{Airfoil}

Let us consider a wing profile $S$ in a uniform flow. Infinity will be
represented by a large circle  $C$ where the flow is assumed to be of uniform velocity;
one way to model this problem is to write
 \begin{eqnarray}&&
 \Delta \psi =0 ~\hbox{~in~}~ \Omega, \qquad
 \psi |_{S}=0, \quad
 \psi|_{C}= {u_\infty}y,
\end{eqnarray}
 where $\partial\Omega=C\cup S $

\paragraph{The NACA0012 Airfoil}
An equation for the upper surface of a NACA0012 (this is a classical
  wing profile in aerodynamics) is:
$$    y = 0.17735\sqrt{x}-0.075597x- 0.212836x^2+0.17363x^3-0.06254x^4.$$
%
\begin{example}[potential.edp]
\bFF
// file potential.edp

@real S=99;
@border C(t=0,2*pi) {  x=5*cos(t);  y=5*sin(t);}

\eFF
\end{example}

A zoom of the streamlines are shown on Figure \ref{figpotential}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{potential}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{potheat}

\caption{\label{figpotential} Zoom around the NACA0012 airfoil showing the streamlines (curve $\psi=$ constant).
To obtain such a plot use the interactive graphic command: ``+" and p.
Right: temperature distribution at time T=25 (now the maximum is at 90 instead of 120).
Note that an incidence angle has been added here (see Chapter 9).}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

 \subsubsection{Heat Convection around the airfoil}
Now let us assume that the airfoil is hot and that air is there to cool it.
Much like in the previous section the heat equation for the temperature $v$ is
$$
\p_t v -\n\cdot(\kappa\n v) + u\cdot\n v =0,~~v(t=0)=v_0, ~~\frac{\p v}{\p n}|_C=0
$$
But now the domain is outside AND inside $S$ and $\kappa$ takes a different value in air
and in steel.  Furthermore there is convection of heat by the flow, hence the
term $u\cdot\n v$ above.  Consider the following, to be plugged at the end of the previous program:
\bFF
...
@border D(t=0,2){x=1+t;y=0;} // added to have a fine mesh at trail
@mesh Sh = @buildmesh(C(25)+Splus(-90)+Sminus(-90)+D(200));
@fespace Wh(Sh,P1); Wh v,vv;
@int steel=Sh(0.5,0).region, air=Sh(-1,0).region;
@fespace W0(Sh,P0);
W0 k=0.01*(@region==air)+0.1*(@region==steel);
W0 u1=@dy(psi)*(@region==air), u2=-@dx(psi)*(@region==air);
Wh vold = 120*(@region==steel);
@real dt=0.05, nbT=50;
@int i;
@problem thermic(v,vv,init=i,solver=LU)= @int2d(Sh)(v*vv/dt
                + k*(@dx(v) * @dx(vv) + @dy(v) * @dy(vv))
                + 10*(u1*@dx(v)+u2*@dy(v))*vv)- @int2d(Sh)(vold*vv/dt);
@for(i=0;i<nbT;i++){
    v=vold; thermic;
 @plot(v);
}
\eFF
Notice here
\begin{itemize}
\item how steel and air are identified by the mesh parameter region which is defined when buildmesh is
called and takes an integer value corresponding to each connected component of $\Omega$;

\item how the convection terms are added without upwinding. Upwinding is necessary when the
Pecley number $|u|L/\kappa$ is large (here is a typical length scale), The factor 10 in front of
the convection terms is a quick way of multiplying the velocity by 10 (else it is too slow to see something).

\item The solver is Gauss' LU factorization and when {\tt init}$\neq 0$ the LU decomposition is reused so it
is much faster after the first iteration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pure Convection : The Rotating Hill}

\paragraph{Summary}\emph{ Here we will present two methods for \x{upwinding} for the simplest
convection problem.  We will learn about \x{Characteristics-Galerkin}
and \x{Discontinuous-Galerkin} Finite Element Methods.}

Let $\Omega$ be the unit disk centered at 0; consider the rotation vector field
$$ \bm{u} = [u1,u2], \qquad u_1 = y,\quad u_2 = -x.$$
Pure convection by $u$ is
$$
    \p_t c  + \bm{u}.\nabla c  = 0~\hbox{~in~}~~\Omega\times(0,T)
    ~~~ c (t=0) =  c ^0~\hbox{~in~}~~\Omega.
$$
The exact solution $c(x_t,t)$ at time $t$ en point $x_t$ is given by
$$
 c(x_t,t)=c^0(x,0)
$$
where $x_t$ is the particle path in the flow starting at point $x$ at time $0$.
So $x_t$ are solutions of
\[
    \dot{x_t} = u(x_t),~~~\vec  , \quad\ x_{t=0} =x , \quad\mbox{where}\quad  \dot{x_t} = \frac{\d ( t \mapsto x_t)}{\d t}
\]
The ODE are reversible and we want the solution at point $x$ at time $t$ ( not at point $x_t$)
the initial point is $x_{-t}$, and we have
$$
 c(x,t)=c^0(x_{-t},0)
$$
The game consists in solving the equation until $T=2\pi$, that is for
a full revolution and to compare the final solution with the initial one;
they should be equal.

\paragraph{Solution by a Characteristics-Galerkin Method} % modif FH 2008
In \freefempp there is an operator called {\tt convect([u1,u2],dt,c)} which compute  \index{convect}
$ c\circ X$ with $X$ is the convect field defined by
$ X(x)= x_{dt}$ and where  $x_\tau$ is particule path in the steady state velocity field $\bm{u}=[u1,u2]$
starting at point $x$ at time $\tau=0$, so $x_\tau$ is solution of the following ODE:
%exactly the equation for ${\vec \chi}:=(X(\tau),Y(\tau))$
\[
    \dot{x}_\tau = u(x_\tau),~~~\vec x_{\tau=0}=x.
\]

When $\bm{u}$ is piecewise constant; this is possible because
$x_\tau$ is then a polygonal curve which can be computed exactly and the solution exists always when
$u$ is divergence free; convect returns  $c(x_{df})=C\circ X$.
 % modif FH 2008
\begin{example}[convects.edp]
\bFF
// file convects.edp

@border C(t=0, 2*pi) { x=cos(t);  y=sin(t); };
@mesh Th = @buildmesh(C(100));
@fespace Uh(Th,P1);
Uh cold, c = exp(-10*((x-0.3)^2 +(y-0.3)^2));

@real dt = 0.17,t=0;
Uh u1 = y, u2 = -x;
@for (int m=0; m<2*pi/dt ; m++) {
    t += dt;     cold=c;
    c=@convect([u1,u2],-dt,cold);
    @plot(c,cmm=" t="+t + ", min=" + c[].min + ", max=" +  c[].max);
}

\eFF
\end{example}
\begin{remark}  3D plots can be done by adding the qualifyer "dim=3" to the plot instruction.
\end{remark}

The method is very powerful but has two limitations: a/ it is not conservative, b/ it may diverge
in rare cases when $|u|$ is too small due to quadrature error.

\paragraph{Solution by Discontinuous-Galerkin FEM}

Discontinuous Galerkin methods take advantage of the discontinuities of $c$ at the edges to build
upwinding.  There are may formulations possible. We shall implement here the so-called dual-$P_1^{DC}$
formulation (see Ern\cite{ern}):
\[
    \int_\Omega(\frac{c^{n+1}-c^n}{\delta t} +u\cdot\n c)w
    +\int_E(\alpha|n\cdot u|-\frac 12 n\cdot u)[c]w
    =\int_{E_\Gamma^-}|n\cdot u| cw~~~\forall w
\]
where $E$ is the set of inner edges and $E_\Gamma^-$ is the set of boundary edges where $u\cdot n<0$
(in our case there is no such edges). Finally $[c]$ is the jump of $c$ across an edge with the convention
that $c^+$ refers to the value on the right of the oriented edge.
\begin{example}[convects\_end.edp]
\bFF
// file convects.edp
...
@fespace Vh(Th,P1dc);

Vh w, ccold, v1 = y, v2 = -x, cc = exp(-10*((x-0.3)^2 +(y-0.3)^2));
@real u, al=0.5;  dt = 0.05;

@macro n() (N.x*v1+N.y*v2) // Macro without parameter \index{macro!without parameter}
@problem  Adual(cc,w) =
@int2d(Th)((cc/dt+(v1*@dx(cc)+v2*@dy(cc)))*w)
  + @intalledges(Th)((1-@nTonEdge)*w*(al*abs(n)-n/2)*@jump(cc))
//  - @int1d(Th,C)((n<0)*abs(n)*cc*w)  // unused because cc=0 on $\p\Omega^-$
  - @int2d(Th)(ccold*w/dt);

for ( t=0; t< 2*pi ; t+=dt)
{
  ccold=cc; Adual;
  @plot(cc,fill=1,cmm="t="+t + ", min=" + cc[].min + ", max=" +  cc[].max);
};
@real [int] viso=[-0.2,-0.1,0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1,1.1];
@plot(c,wait=1,fill=1,ps="convectCG.eps",viso=viso);
@plot(c,wait=1,fill=1,ps="convectDG.eps",viso=viso);

\eFF
\end{example}
Notice the new keywords, \texttt{intalledges} to integrate on all edges of all triangles
\begin{equation}
\mathtt{intalledges}(\mathtt{Th}) \equiv \sum_{T\in\mathtt{Th}}\int_{\p T }
\end{equation}

(so all internal edges are see two times ), \x{nTonEdge} which is one
if the triangle has a boundary edge and zero otherwise, {\tt jump} to implement $[c]$.
Results of both methods are shown on Figure \ref{figconvect} with identical levels for the \x{level line};
this is done with the plot-modifier \x{viso}.
\index{plot!viso=}

Notice also the  \x{macro} where the parameter $u$ is not used (but
the syntax needs one) and which ends with a //; it simply replaces
the name {\tt n} by {\tt (N.x*v1+N.y*v2)}. As easily guessed {\tt
N.x,N.y} is the \x{normal} to the edge.

\end{figure}

Now if you think that DG is too slow try this
\bFF

// the same DG very much faster
@varf aadual(cc,w) = @int2d(Th)((cc/dt+(v1*@dx(cc)+v2*@dy(cc)))*w)
        + @intalledges(Th)((1-@nTonEdge)*w*(al*abs(n)-n/2)*@jump(cc));
@varf bbdual(ccold,w) =  - @int2d(Th)(ccold*w/dt);
@matrix  AA= aadual(Vh,Vh);
@matrix BB = bbdual(Vh,Vh);
@set (AA,init=t,solver=sparsesolver);
Vh rhs=0;
@for ( t=0; t< 2*pi ; t+=dt)
{
  ccold=cc;
  rhs[] = BB* ccold[];
  cc[] = AA^-1*rhs[];
  @plot(cc,fill=0,cmm="t="+t + ", min=" + cc[].min + ", max=" +  cc[].max);
};
\eFF
Notice the new keyword \x{set} to specify a solver in this framework; the modifier \x{init} is used
to tel the solver that the matrix has not changed (init=true), and the name parameter are the
same that in problem definition (see. \ref{def problem}) \index{set}\index{problem}.

\paragraph{\x{Finite Volume Methods}} can also be handled with \freefempp but it requires programming.
For instance the $P_0-P_1$ Finite Volume Method of Dervieux et al associates to each $P_0$
function $c^1$ a $P_0$ function $c^0$ with constant value around each vertex $q^i$ equal to $c^1(q^i)$
on the cell $\sigma_i$ made by all the medians of all triangles having $q^i$ as vertex.
Then upwinding is done by taking left or right values at the median:
\[
    \int_{\sigma_i}\frac 1{\delta t}({c^1}^{n+1}-{c^1}^n) + \int_{\p\sigma_i}u\cdot n c^-=0
    ~~~\forall i
\]
It can be programmed as
\bFF
@load "mat_dervieux";  // external module in C++ must be loaded
@border a(t=0, 2*pi){ x = cos(t); y = sin(t);  }
@mesh th = @buildmesh(a(100));
@fespace Vh(th,P1);

Vh vh,vold,u1 = y, u2 = -x;
Vh v = exp(-10*((x-0.3)^2 +(y-0.3)^2)), vWall=0, rhs =0;

@real dt = 0.025;
// qf1pTlump means mass lumping is used
@problem  FVM(v,vh) = @int2d(th,qft=qf1pTlump)(v*vh/dt)
                  - @int2d(th,qft=qf1pTlump)(vold*vh/dt)
      + @int1d(th,a)(((u1*N.x+u2*N.y)<0)*(u1*N.x+u2*N.y)*vWall*vh)
+ rhs[] ;

@matrix A;
MatUpWind0(A,th,vold,[u1,u2]);

@for ( @int t=0; t< 2*pi ; t+=dt){
  vold=v;
  rhs[] = A * vold[] ; FVM;
  @plot(v,wait=0);
};
\eFF
the \x{mass lumping} parameter forces a quadrature formula with Gauss points at the vertices
so as to make the mass matrix diagonal; the linear system solved by a conjugate gradient method for
instance will then converge in one or two iterations.

\index{MatUpWind0}
The right hand side {\tt rhs} is computed by an \x{external C++ function} {\tt MatUpWind0(...)}
which is programmed as
\bFF
// computes matrix a on a triangle for the Dervieux FVM
@int   fvmP1P0(@double q[3][2], // the 3 vertices of a triangle T
              @double u[2],   // convection velocity on T
              @double c[3],   // the P1 function on T
              @double a[3][3],// output matrix
              @double where[3] ) // where>0 means we're on the boundary
{
  @for(@int i=0;i<3;i++) @for(@int j=0;j<3;j++) a[i][j]=0;

    @for(@int i=0;i<3;i++){
        @int ip = (i+1)%3, ipp =(ip+1)%3;
        @double unL =-((q[ip][1]+q[i][1]-2*q[ipp][1])*u[0]
                    -(q[ip][0]+q[i][0]-2*q[ipp][0])*u[1])/6;
        @if(unL>0) { a[i][i] += unL; a[ip][i]-=unL;}
            @else{ a[i][ip] += unL; a[ip][ip]-=unL;}
        @if(where[i]&&where[ip]){        // this is a boundary edge
            unL=((q[ip][1]-q[i][1])*u[0] -(q[ip][0]-q[i][0])*u[1])/2;
            if(unL>0) { a[i][i]+=unL; a[ip][ip]+=unL;}
        }
    }
  return 1;
}
\eFF
It must be inserted into a larger .cpp file, shown in Appendix A,
 which is the load module linked to \freefempp.


 \subsection{The System of elasticity}

\paragraph{Elasticity}

Solid objects deform under the action of applied forces:
a point in the solid, originally at $(x,y,z)$ will come to $(X,Y,Z)$
after some time; the vector $\mathbf{u}=(u_1,u_2,u_3) = (X-x, Y-y, Z-z)$ is called
the displacement. When the displacement is small and the solid is
elastic, Hooke's law gives a relationship between the stress tensor
$\sigma(u)=(\sigma_{ij}(u) )$ and the strain tensor $\epsilon(u)=\epsilon_{ij}(u)$
$$
\sigma_{ij}(u) = \lambda \delta_{ij} \nabla.\mathbf{u}+ 2\mu\epsilon_{ij}(u),
$$
where the Kronecker symbol $\delta_{ij} = 1$ if $i=j$, $0$ otherwise, with
$$\epsilon_{ij}(u) = {1\over 2}({\p u_i\over\p x_j} +
{\p u_j\over\p x_i} ),
$$
and where $\lambda, \mu$ are two constants that describe the
mechanical properties of the solid, and are themselves related to the
better known constants $E$, Young's modulus, and $\nu$, Poisson's ratio:
$$ \mu = {E\over 2( 1+\nu)}, \quad \lambda = {E\nu\over (1+\nu)(1-2\nu)}.
$$


 \paragraph{Lam\'e's system}

Let us consider a beam with axis $Oz$ and with perpendicular section
$\Omega$. The components along $x$ and $y$ of the strain ${\bf u}(x)$
in a section $\Omega$ subject to forces ${\bf f}$ perpendicular to the
axis are governed by \\
$$
  -\mu \Delta {\bf u} - (\mu+\lambda)  \nabla (\nabla .{\bf u})={\bf f}~~\hbox{in}~~\Omega,
$$
 where $\lambda ,\mu  $ are the Lam\'{e} coefficients introduced above.

Remark, we do not used this equation because the associated  variationnal
form does not give the right boundary condition, we simply use
$$
  - div( \sigma ) = \mathbf{f}  \quad  \mbox{in} \Omega
$$
where the corresponding variationnal form is:
$$
 \int_{\Omega} \sigma(u) : \epsilon(\mathbf{v})\;dx - \int_{\Omega}  \mathbf{v} f \;dx =0;
$$
where $:$  denote the tensor scalar product,   i.e. $ a: b = \sum_{i,j}  a_{ij}b_{ij}$.

So the variationnal form can be written as :
$$
 \int_{\Omega} \lambda \nabla.u   \nabla.v  + 2 \mu \epsilon(\mathbf{u}):\epsilon(\mathbf{v}) \; dx - \int_{\Omega}  \mathbf{v} f  \;dx  =0;
$$
 \paragraph{Example}  Consider  elastic plate with the undeformed rectangle shape
$[0,20]\times [-1,1]$.
The body force is the gravity force $\vec f$ and the
boundary force $\vec g$ is zero on lower, upper and right sides.
 The left vertical sides of the beam is fixed.
 The boundary conditions are
\begin{eqnarray*}
     \sigma . {\bf n}  &=& g = 0    ~~\hbox{on}~~\Gamma_1, \Gamma_4, \Gamma_3, \\
      {\bf u} &=& \mathbf{0} ~~\hbox{on}~~\Gamma_2
 \end{eqnarray*}
Here ${\bf u}=(u,v) $ has two components.\bigskip

The above two equations are strongly coupled by their mixed
derivatives, and thus any iterative solution on each of the
components is risky. One should rather use \freefempp's system
approach and write:

\subsection{The System of Stokes for Fluids}

In the case of a flow invariant with respect to the third coordinate
(two-dimensional flow), flows at low Reynolds number (for instance
micro-organisms) satisfy,
\begin{eqnarray*}&&
    \vec -\Delta u + \n p =0
    \cr&&
    \n\cdot \vec u =0
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\vec u=(u_1,u_2)$ is the fluid velocity and $p$ its pressure.
\\
The driven cavity is a standard test. It is a box full of liquid with its lid moving horizontally
at speed one.  The pressure and the velocity must be discretized in compatible fintie
element spaces for the LBB conditions to be satisfied:
\[
    \sup_{p\in P_h}\frac{(\vec u,\n p)}{|p|}\geq \beta|\vec u|~~~\forall \vec u\in U_h
\]
\bFF
//file stokes.edp
@int n=3;
@mesh Th=@square(10*n,10*n);
@fespace Uh(Th,P1b); Uh u,v,uu,vv;
@fespace Ph(Th,P1);  Ph p,pp;

@solve stokes([u,v,p],[uu,vv,pp]) =

Remark, we add a stabilization term {\bf{-10e-10*p*pp}} to fixe the constant part of the pressure.

%\subsection{A Large Fluid Problem}
%A friend of one of us in Auroville-India was building a ramp to access an air conditioned room. As I was visiting the construction site he told me that he expected to cool air escaping by the door to the room to slide down the ramp and refrigerate the feet of the coming visitors.  I told him "no way" and decided to check numerically.  The results are on the front page of this book.
%\\
%The fluid velocity and pressure are solution of the Navier-Stokes equations with varying density function of the temperature.
%\\
%The geometry is trapezoidal with prescribed inflow made of cool air at the bottom and warm air above and so are the initial conditions; there is free outflow, slip velocity at the top (artificial) boundary and no-slip at the bottom.  However the Navier-Stokes cum temperature equations have a RANS $k-\epsilon$ model and a Boussinesq approximation for the buoyancy. This comes to
%\begin{eqnarray}&&
%\p_t\theta+u\n\theta-\n\cdot(\kappa_T^m\n\theta)=0
%\cr&&
%\p_t u +u\n u -\n\cdot(\mu_T\n u) +\n p+ e(\theta-\theta_0)\vec e_2,~~\n\cdot u=0
%\cr&&
%\mu_T = c_\mu\frac{k^2}\epsilon,~~\kappa_T=\kappa\mu_T
%\cr&&
%\p_t k + u\n k + \epsilon  -\n\cdot(\mu_T\n k)  = \frac{\mu_T}2|\n u+\n u^T|^2
%\cr&&
%\p_t\epsilon+u\n\epsilon + c_2\frac{\epsilon^2} k -\frac{c_\epsilon}{c_\mu}\n\dot(\mu_T\n\epsilon)= \frac{c_1}2  k|\n u+\n u^T|^2=0
%\end{eqnarray}
%We use a time discretization which preserves positivity and uses the method of characteristics ($X^m\approx x-u^m(x)\delta t$)
%\begin{eqnarray}&&
%\frac 1{\delta t}(\theta^{m+1}-\theta^m \circ X^m)-\n\cdot(\kappa_T^m\n\theta^{m+1})=0
%\cr&&
%\frac1{\delta t}(u^{m+1}-u^m \circ X^m) -\n\cdot(\mu_T^m\n u^{m+1}) +\n p^{m+1}+ e(\theta^{m+1}-\theta_0)\vec e_2
%,~~\n\cdot u^{m+1}=0
%\cr&&
%\frac1{\delta t}(k^{m+1}-k^m \circ X^m) + k^{m+1}\frac{\epsilon^m}{k^m}  -\n\cdot(\mu_T^m\n k^{m+1})  = \frac{\mu_T^m}2|\n u^m+{\n u^m}^T|^2
%\cr&&
%\frac1{\delta t}(\epsilon^{m+1}-\epsilon^m \circ X^m) + c_2\epsilon^{m+1}\frac{\epsilon^m} {k^m} -\frac{c_\epsilon}{c_\mu}\n\dot(\mu_T^m\n\epsilon^{m+1})= \frac{c_1}2  k^m|\n u^m+{\n u^m}^T|^2

\subsection{A Projection Algorithm for the Navier-Stokes equations }
\paragraph{Summary}\emph{Fluid flows require good algorithms and good triangultions. We show
here an example of a complex algorithm and or first example of \x{mesh adaptation}}.
\\\\
An incompressible viscous fluid satisfies:
$$ \p _t u + u\cdot\nabla u + \nabla p - \nu\Delta u = 0,\quad  \nabla\cdot u=0
\quad  \hbox{ in } \Omega\times ]0,T[,
$$
$$ u|_{t=0} = u^0,\quad  u|_\Gamma = u_\Gamma.
$$
A possible algorithm, proposed by Chorin, is
$$ {1\over \delta t}[u^{m+1} - u^moX^m] + \nabla p^m -\nu\Delta u^m= 0,\quad  u|_\Gamma
 = u_\Gamma,
 $$
$$ -\Delta p^{m+1} = -\nabla\cdot  u^moX^m, \quad  \p _n p^{m+1} = 0,
$$
where $uoX(x) = u(x-u(x)\delta t)$ since $\p _t u + u\cdot\nabla
u $ is approximated by the method of characteristics, as in the previous section.
\\\\
An improvement over Chorin's algorithm, given by Rannacher, is to compute a correction, q,
to the pressure (the overline denotes the mean over $\Omega$)
\[
    -\Delta q= \n\cdot\vec u - \overline{\n\cdot\vec u}
\]
and define
\[
    u^{m+1}=\tilde u + \n q\delta t,~~~p^{m+1}=p^m-q-\overline{p^m-q}
\]
where $\tilde u$ is the $(u^{m+1},v^{m+1})$ of Chorin's algorithm.

\paragraph{The backward facing step}

The geometry is that of a channel with a backward facing step so that
the inflow section is smaller than the outflow section. This geometry
produces a fluid recirculation zone that must be captured correctly.

This can only be done if the triangulation is sufficiently fine, or
well adapted to the flow.

Remark (FH), The are a technical difficulty is the example, the discret flow flux must be 
$0$ and in the previous version this is not the case, the correction is not so simple.

\subsection{Newton Method for the Steady Navier-Stokes equations}

The problem is find the velocity field $\bm{u}=(u_i)_{i=1}^d$ and the pressure $p$ of a Flow 
satisfying in the domain $\Omega \subset  \mathbb{R}^d (d=2,3)$:
\Blue{\begin{eqnarray*}
 (\bm{u}\cdot\nabla) \bm{u}-\nu \Delta \bm{u}+\nabla p&=&0,\\ \nabla\cdot \bm{u}&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}}
where $\nu$ is the viscosity of the fluid, $\nabla = (\p_i )_{i=1}^d $, the dot product is $\cdot$, and  $\Delta = \nabla\cdot\nabla$
with the some boundary conditions ( $\bm{u}$ is  given on $\Gamma$)

\bigskip

The weak form is 
find $\bm{u}, p $ such than for $\forall \bm{v}$ (zero on $\Gamma$), and $\forall  q$ 
\Blue{\begin{equation}
  \int_\Omega  ((\bm{u}\cdot\nabla) \bm{u} ). \bm v + \nu \nabla \bm{u}:\nabla \bm{v} 
  - p \nabla\cdot \bm{v} - q \nabla\cdot \bm{u} = 0 
\end{equation}}


The Newton Algorithm to solve nonlinear Problem is

Find  $u\in  V$ such that $F(u)=0$ where 
$ F : V \mapsto V $. 

\begin{enumerate} \index{Newton Algorithm
}
\item choose $u_0\in \R^n $ , ;
\item for ( $i =0$; $i$ < niter; $i = i+1$) 

\begin{enumerate}
\item solve $DF(u_i) w_i =  F(u_i)$;
\item $u_{i+1} = u_i - w_i$;  
\end{enumerate}
 break  $|| w_i|| < \varepsilon$.
\end{enumerate}

Where $DF(u)$ is the differential of $F$ at point  $u$, this is a linear application such that:
{$
  F(u+\delta) = F(u) + DF(u) \delta + o(\delta) 
$}


For Navier Stokes, $F$ and $DF$ are  :
\Blue{\small
\begin{eqnarray*}F(\bm{u},p) =  \int_\Omega  &&((\bm{u}\cdot\nabla) \bm{u} ). \bm v + \nu \nabla \bm{u}:\nabla \bm{v} 
  - p \nabla\cdot \bm{v} - q \nabla\cdot \bm{u}\\
DF(\bm{u},p)(\bm{\delta u} ,\delta p)  =  \int_\Omega  &&((\bm{\delta u}\cdot\nabla) \bm{u} ). \bm v + ((\bm{u}\cdot\nabla) \bm{\delta u} ). \bm v \\
 &+& \nu \nabla \bm{\delta u}:\nabla \bm{v}  - \delta p \nabla\cdot \bm{v} - q \nabla\cdot \bm{\delta u}
\end{eqnarray*}}



So the Newton algorithm become

\subsection{A Large Fluid Problem}
A friend of one of us in Auroville-India was building a ramp to access an air conditioned room. As I was visiting the construction site he told me that he expected to cool air escaping by the door to the room to slide down the ramp and refrigerate the feet of the coming visitors.  I told him "no way" and decided to check numerically.  The results are on the front page of this book.
\\
The fluid velocity and pressure are solution of the Navier-Stokes equations with varying density function of the temperature.
\\
The geometry is trapezoidal with prescribed inflow made of cool air at the bottom and warm air above and so are the initial conditions; there is free outflow, slip velocity at the top (artificial) boundary and no-slip at the bottom.  However the Navier-Stokes cum temperature equations have a RANS $k-\epsilon$ model and a Boussinesq approximation for the buoyancy. This comes to
\begin{eqnarray}&&
\p_t\theta+u\n\theta-\n\cdot(\kappa_T^m\n\theta)=0
\cr&&
\p_t u +u\n u -\n\cdot(\mu_T\n u) +\n p+ e(\theta-\theta_0)\vec e_2,~~\n\cdot u=0
\cr&&
\mu_T = c_\mu\frac{k^2}\epsilon,~~\kappa_T=\kappa\mu_T
\cr&&
\p_t k + u\n k + \epsilon  -\n\cdot(\mu_T\n k)  = \frac{\mu_T}2|\n u+\n u^T|^2
\cr&&
\p_t\epsilon+u\n\epsilon + c_2\frac{\epsilon^2} k -\frac{c_\epsilon}{c_\mu}\n\cdot (\mu_T\n\epsilon)= \frac{c_1}2  k|\n u+\n u^T|^2=0
\end{eqnarray}
We use a time discretization which preserves positivity and uses the method of characteristics ($X^m(x)\approx  x-u^m(x)\delta t$)
\begin{eqnarray}&&
\frac 1{\delta t}(\theta^{m+1}-\theta^m \circ X^m)-\n\cdot(\kappa_T^m\n\theta^{m+1})=0
\cr&&
\frac1{\delta t}(u^{m+1}-u^m \circ X^m) -\n\cdot(\mu_T^m\n u^{m+1}) +\n p^{m+1}+ e(\theta^{m+1}-\theta_0)\vec e_2
,~~\n\cdot u^{m+1}=0
\cr&&
\frac1{\delta t}(k^{m+1}-k^m \circ X^m) + k^{m+1}\frac{\epsilon^m}{k^m}  -\n\cdot(\mu_T^m\n k^{m+1})  = \frac{\mu_T^m}2|\n u^m+{\n u^m}^T|^2
\cr&&
\frac1{\delta t}(\epsilon^{m+1}-\epsilon^m \circ X^m) + c_2\epsilon^{m+1}\frac{\epsilon^m} {k^m} -\frac{c_\epsilon}{c_\mu}\n\dot(\mu_T^m\n\epsilon^{m+1})= \frac{c_1}2  k^m|\n u^m+{\n u^m}^T|^2
\cr&&
\mu_T ^{m+1}= c_\mu\frac{{k^{m+1}}^2}{\epsilon^{m+1}},~~\kappa_T^{m+1}=\kappa\mu_T^{m+1}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{An Example with Complex Numbers}

 \index{FE function!complex}\index{complex}\index{Helmholtz}
In a microwave oven heat comes from molecular excitation by an
electromagnetic field. For a plane monochromatic wave, amplitude is
given by Helmholtz's equation:
$$ \beta v + \Delta v = 0.
$$
We consider a rectangular oven where the wave is emitted by part of
the upper wall. So the boundary of the domain is made up of a part
$\Gamma_1$ where $v=0$ and of another part $\Gamma_2=[c,d]$ where for
instance $v=\sin(\pi{y-c\over c-d})$.

Within an object to be cooked, denoted by $B$, the heat source is
proportional to $v^2$.
At equilibrium, one has

$$-\Delta\theta = v^2 I_B, \quad \theta_\Gamma = 0
$$
where $I_B$ is $1$ in the object and $0$ elsewhere.

\subsection{Optimal Control} Thanks to the function \texttt{BFGS} it
is possible to solve complex nonlinear optimization problem within
\texttt{FreeFem++}. For example consider the following inverse
problem
\[
    \min_{b,c,d\in R}J=\int_E(u-u_d)^2~:~
    -\nabla(\kappa(b,c,d)\cdot\nabla u)=0,~~u|_\Gamma=u_\Gamma
\]
where the desired state $u_d$, the boundary data $u_\Gamma$ and the
observation set $E\subset\Omega$ are all given.  Furthermore let us
assume that
\[
    \kappa(x)=1+bI_B(x)+cI_C(x)+dI_D(x)~~~\forall x\in\Omega
\]
where $B,C,D$ are separated subsets of $\Omega$.
\\\\
To solve this problem by the quasi-Newton BFGS method we need the
derivatives of $J$ with respect to $b,c,d$.  We self explanatory
notations, if $\delta b,\delta c,\delta d$ are variations of
$b,c,d$ we have
\[
    \delta J\approx 2\int_E(u-u_d)\delta u,~~
    -\nabla(\kappa\cdot\nabla\delta u)\approx\nabla(\delta\kappa\cdot\nabla
    u)
    ~~\delta u|_\Gamma=0
\]
Obviously $J'_b$ is equal to $\delta J$ when $\delta b=1,\delta
c=0,\delta d=0$, and so on for $J'_c$ and $J'_d$.
\\\\
All this is implemented in the following program
 \bFF
// file optimcontrol.edp
@border aa(t=0, 2*pi) {    x = 5*cos(t);    y = 5*sin(t);  };
@border bb(t=0, 2*pi) {    x = cos(t);    y = sin(t);  };
@border cc(t=0, 2*pi) {    x = -3+cos(t);    y = sin(t);  };
@border dd(t=0, 2*pi) {    x = cos(t);    y = -3+sin(t);  };
@mesh th = @buildmesh(aa(70)+bb(35)+cc(35)+dd(35));
@fespace Vh(th,P1);
Vh Ib=((x^2+y^2)<1.0001),
   Ic=(((x+3)^2+ y^2)<1.0001),
   Id=((x^2+(y+3)^2)<1.0001),
   Ie=(((x-1)^2+ y^2)<=4),
   ud,u,uh,du;
@real[int] z(3);
@problem A(u,uh) =@int2d(th)((1+z[0]*Ib+z[1]*Ic+z[2]*Id)*(dx(u)*dx(uh)
                    +dy(u)*dy(uh))) + on(aa,u=x^3-y^3);
z[0]=2; z[1]=3; z[2]=4;
A; ud=u;
@ofstream f("J.txt");
@func @real J(real[int] & Z)
{
    @for (int i=0;i<z.n;i++)z[i]=Z[i];
    A; @real s= @int2d(th)(Ie*(u-ud)^2);
    f<<s<<"   "; @return s;
}

@real[int] dz(3), dJdz(3);

@problem B(du,uh)
  =@int2d(th)((1+z[0]*Ib+z[1]*Ic+z[2]*Id)*(dx(du)*dx(uh)+dy(du)*dy(uh)))
  +@int2d(th)((dz[0]*Ib+dz[1]*Ic+dz[2]*Id)*(dx(u)*dx(uh)+dy(u)*dy(uh)))
  +@on(aa,du=0);

@func @real[int] DJ(@real[@int] &Z)
    {
      @for(int i=0;i<z.n;i++)
        { @for(int j=0;j<dz.n;j++) dz[j]=0;
          dz[i]=1; B;
          dJdz[i]= 2*int2d(th)(Ie*(u-ud)*du);
      }
     @return dJdz;
 }

 @real[@int] Z(3);
 @for(@int j=0;j<z.n;j++) Z[j]=1;
 BFGS(J,DJ,Z,eps=1.e-6,nbiter=15,nbiterline=20);
 @cout << "BFGS: J(z) = " << J(Z) <<  endl;
 @for(int j=0;j<z.n;j++) cout<<z[j]<<endl;
 @plot(ud,value=1,ps="u.eps");
\eFF
In this example the sets $B,C,D,E$ are circles of boundaries $bb,cc,dd,ee$ are the domain
$\Omega$ is the circle of boundary $aa$.  The desired state $u_d$ is the solution
of the PDE for $b=2,c=3,d=4$.  The unknowns are packed into array $z$.  Notice that it is
necessary to recopy $Z$ into $z$ because one is a local variable while the other one is global.
The program found $b=2.00125,c=3.00109,d=4.00551$.
Figure \ref{figcontrol} shows $u$ at convergence
and the successive function evaluations of $J$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{u-bfgs}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{J-bfgs}
\caption{\label{figcontrol}On the left the level lines of $u$. On the right the successive evaluations of
$J$ by BFGS (5 values above 500 have been removed for readability)}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Note that an \emph{adjoint state} could have been used. Define $p$ by
\[
-\nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla p)=2I_E(u-u_d),~~~p|_\Gamma=0
\]
Consequently
\begin{eqnarray}&&
\delta J = -\int_{\Omega} (\nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla p))\delta u
\cr&&
= \int_\Omega(\kappa\nabla p\cdot\nabla\delta u)
=-\int_\Omega(\delta\kappa\nabla p\cdot\nabla u)
\end{eqnarray}
Then the derivatives are found by setting $\delta b=1, \delta c=\delta d=0$ and so on:
\[
    J'_b=-\int_B \nabla p\cdot\nabla u,~~J'_c=-\int_C \nabla p\cdot\nabla u,~~
    J'_d=-\int_D \nabla p\cdot\nabla u
\]
\paragraph{Remark} As BFGS stores an $M\times M$ matrix where $M$ is the number of
unknowns, it is dangerously expensive to use this method when the unknown $x$ is a
Finite Element Function.  One should use another optimizer such as
the NonLinear Conjugate Gradient \texttt{NLCG} (also a key word
of \texttt{FreeFem++}).  See the file algo.edp in the examples folder.

\subsection{A Flow with Shocks}
Compressible Euler  equations should be discretized with Finite Volumes or FEM with flux up-winding scheme but these are not implemented in \freefempp.  Nevertheless acceptable results can be obtained with the method of characteristics
provided that the mean values $\bar f=\frac12(f^++f^-)$ are used at shocks in the scheme, and finally  mesh adaptation \index{adaptmesh}\index{mesh!adaptation}.%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{euler}&&
    \p_t\rho+\bar u\n\rho + \bar\rho\n\cdot u=0
    \cr&&
   \bar\rho( \p_t u+\frac{\overline{\rho u}}{\bar\rho}\n u +\n p=0
    \cr&&
    \p_t p + \bar u\n p +(\gamma-1)\bar p\n\cdot u =0
\end{eqnarray}
%
One possibility is to couple $u,p$ and then update $\rho$, i.e.
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eulalgo}&&
    \frac 1{(\gamma-1)\delta t\bar p^m} (p^{m+1}-p^m \circ X^m) + \n\cdot u^{m+1} =0
    \cr&&
    \frac{\bar\rho^m}{\delta t}(u^{m+1}-u^m \circ {\tilde X}^m ) +\n p^{m+1}=0
    \cr&&
    \rho^{m+1} = \rho^m \circ X^m +
        \frac{\bar\rho^m}{(\gamma-1)\bar p^m}(p^{m+1}-p^m \circ X^m)
\end{eqnarray}
A numerical result is given on Figure \ref{figvfive} and the \freefempp script is

 \subsection{Classification of the equations}
\paragraph{Summary}\emph{
It is usually not easy to determine the type of a system.  Yet the approximations
and algorithms suited to the problem depend on its type:
\begin{itemize}
\item Finite Elements compatible (LBB conditions) for elliptic systems
\item Finite difference on the parabolic variable and a time loop on each
elliptic subsystem of parabolic systems; better stability diagrams when the schemes are implicit in time.
\item Upwinding, Petrov-Galerkin, Characteristics-Galerkin, Discontinuous-Galerkin, Finite Volumes
for hyperbolic systems plus, possibly, a time loop.
\end{itemize}
When the system changes type, then expect difficulties (like shock discontinuities)!}

 \paragraph{Elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic equations}

A partial differential equation (PDE) is a relation between a function
of several variables and its derivatives.
 $$
 F(\varphi(x),{\p\varphi\over\p
 x_1}(x),\cdots,{\p\varphi\over\p
 x_d}(x),{\p^2\varphi\over\p
 x^2_1}(x),\cdots,{\p^m\varphi\over\p x^m_d}(x)) =
 0\quad\forall x\in\Omega\subset \Rel^d.
 $$
 The range of $x$ over which the equation is taken, here $\Omega$, is called
 the \emph{domain} of the PDE.
The highest derivation index, here $m$, is called the {\it
 order}. If $F$ and $\varphi$ are vector valued functions, then the
 PDE is actually a \emph{system} of PDEs.
 \\
Unless indicated otherwise, here by convention \emph{one} PDE
 corresponds to one scalar valued $F$ and $\varphi$.
If $F$ is linear with respect to its arguments, then the PDE is said
 to be \emph{linear}.
 \\
The general form of a second order, linear scalar PDE is
${\p^2\varphi\over\p x_i\p x_j}$ and $A:B$ means
 $\sum^d_{i,j=1} a_{ij} b_{ij}.$
 $$\alpha\varphi + a\cdot\nabla\varphi + B :\nabla(\nabla\varphi) =
 f{\quad\hbox{ in }\quad}\Omega\subset \Rel^d,
 $$
 where $f(x),\alpha(x)\in \Rel,
 a(x)\in \Rel^d, B(x)\in \Rel^{d\times d}$
are the PDE \emph{coefficients}.
If the coefficients are independent of $x$, the PDE is said to have
 \emph{constant coefficients}.

To a PDE we associate a quadratic form, by replacing
$\varphi$ by $1$,
 $\p\varphi/\p x_i$ by $z_i$ and
 $\p^2\varphi/\p x_i\p x_j$ by $z_i z_j$, where $z$
 is a vector in $\Rel^d$~:
 $$\alpha + a\cdot z + z^T Bz = f.
 $$
If it is the equation of an ellipse (ellipsoid if $d \geq 2$),
the PDE is said to be {\it elliptic};
if it is the equation of a parabola or a hyperbola, the PDE is said to
be {\it parabolic} or {\it hyperbolic}. If $A \equiv 0$, the degree is
no longer 2 but 1, and for reasons that will appear more clearly
later, the PDE is still said to be hyperbolic.
\\\\
These concepts can be generalized to systems, by studying whether or
not the polynomial system $P(z)$ associated with the PDE system has
branches at infinity (ellipsoids have no branches at infinity,
paraboloids have one, and hyperboloids have several).
\\
If the PDE is not linear, it is said to be \emph{non linear}.
Those are said to be locally elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic
according to the type of the linearized equation.
\\
For example, for the non linear equation
 $${\p^2\varphi\over\p t^2} - {\p\varphi\over\p
 x}{\p^2\varphi\over\p x^2} = 1,
 $$
  we have $d=2, x_1 = t, x_2 = x$ and its linearized form is:
 $${\p^2 u\over\p t^2} - {\p u\over\p x}
 {\p^2\varphi\over\p x^2} - {\p\varphi\over\p
 x}{\p^2 u\over\p x^2} = 0,
 $$
which for the unknown $u$ is locally elliptic if
 ${\p\varphi\over\p x} < 0$  and locally hyperbolic if
 ${\p\varphi\over\p x} > 0$.

\paragraph{Examples}

 \noindent{Laplace's} equation is elliptic:
 $$\Delta\varphi \equiv {\p^2\varphi\over\p x^2_1} +
 {\p^2\varphi\over\p x^2_2} + \cdots +
 {\p^2\varphi\over\p x^2_d} = f, \ \ \ \forall x
 \in \Omega\subset \Rel^d.
 $$
The \emph{heat} equation is parabolic in
 $Q = \Omega\times]0,T[\subset \Rel^{d+1}$~:
 $${\p\varphi\over\p t} - \mu\Delta\varphi = f\quad\forall
 x\in\Omega\subset  \Rel^d, \quad\forall t\in]0,T[.
 $$
If $\mu >0$,  the \emph{wave} equation is hyperbolic:
 $${\p^2\varphi\over\p t^2} - \mu\Delta\varphi =
 f{\quad\hbox{~in~}\quad}  Q.
 $$
The \emph{convection diffusion} equation is parabolic if $\mu \neq 0$
 and hyperbolic otherwise:
 $${\p\varphi\over\p t} + a\nabla\varphi -
 \mu\Delta\varphi = f.
 $$
The \emph{biharmonic} equation is elliptic:
 $$\Delta(\Delta\varphi) = f{\quad\hbox{~in~}\quad}\Omega.
 $$

\paragraph{Boundary conditions}

A relation between a function and its derivatives is not sufficient to define the function.
Additional information on the boundary $\Gamma=\p\Omega$ of
$\Omega$, or on part of $\Gamma$ is necessary.\\
Such information is called a \emph{boundary condition}.
For example,
 $$\varphi(x) \ \hbox{given},\ \forall x\in \Gamma,
 $$
is called a \emph{\x{Dirichlet} boundary condition}.
The \emph{\x{Neumann}} condition is
 $${\p\varphi\over\p n}(x) \ \hbox{given on }\
 \Gamma \hbox{~~~(or~~} n\cdot B\nabla\varphi,\hbox{given on }\
 \Gamma\hbox{ for a general second order PDE)}
$$
  where $n$ is the normal at $x\in\Gamma$
directed towards the exterior of $\Omega$ (by definition
 ${\p\varphi\over\p n}=\nabla\varphi\cdot n$).

Another classical condition, called a \emph{Robin} (or \emph{Fourier})
condition is written as:
 $$\varphi(x) + \beta(x) {\p\varphi\over\p n}(x) \
 \hbox{given on}\
 \Gamma.
 $$
Finding a set of boundary conditions  that defines a unique
 $\varphi$ is a difficult art.\\
In general, an elliptic equation is well posed (\emph{i.e.} $\varphi$
 is unique) with one Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin conditions on the whole boundary.
 \\
Thus, Laplace's equations  is well posed with
 a Dirichlet or Neumann condition but also with
 $$\varphi \ \hbox{given on}\ \Gamma_1,\quad {\p\varphi\over
 \p n} \
 \hbox{given on}\ \Gamma_2, \quad \Gamma_1\cup\Gamma_2 =
 \Gamma,\quad{\dot{\Gamma_1}\cap\dot{\Gamma_2}} =
 \emptyset.$$
Parabolic and hyperbolic equations rarely require boundary conditions
 on all of  $\Gamma\times]0,T[$. For instance, the heat equation
 is well posed with
 $$\varphi \ \hbox{given at}\ t=0 \ \hbox{and Dirichlet or Neumann or mixed conditions on}\
 \p\Omega.$$
Here $t$ is time so the first condition is called an \x{initial condition}.  The whole set of conditions
are also called \x{Cauchy} conditions.
\\
The wave equation  is well posed with
 $$\varphi \ \hbox{and}\ {\p\varphi\over\p t} \
 \hbox{given at}\ t=0
 \ \hbox{and Dirichlet or Neumann or mixed conditions on}\
 \p\Omega.
 $$

\section{Syntax}
\subsection{Data Types}
In essence \freefempp  is a \index{compiler} compiler:
  its language is typed, polymorphic, with exception and reentrant.
Every variable must be declared of a certain type,  in a  declarative statement;
each statement are separated
from the next by a semicolon `\texttt{;}'.
The language allows the manipulation of basic types
integers (\texttt{int}), reals (\texttt{real}), strings (\texttt{string}),
arrays (example: \texttt{real[int]}),
 bidimensional (2D) finite element meshes (\texttt{mesh}),
2D finite element spaces (\texttt{fespace}) , analytical functions
(\texttt{func}), arrays of
finite element functions (\texttt{func$[basic\_type]$}),
linear and bilinear operators, sparse matrices, vectors , etc. For instance

\bFF
  @int i,n=20;               //  $ i,n$ are integer.
  @real[@int] xx(n),yy(n);    //  two array of size n
  @for (i=0;i<=20;i++)       // which can be used in statements such as
   { xx[i]= cos(i*pi/10); yy[i]= sin(i*pi/10); }
\eFF
The life of a variable is the current block $\{\ldots \}$, except the \texttt{fespace}
variable, and the variables local to a block are destroyed at the end of the block as follows.
\begin{example}~~
\bFF
@real r= 0.01;
@mesh Th=@square(10,10); // unit square mesh
@fespace Vh(Th,@P1);     // P1 lagrange finite  element space
Vh u = x+ exp(y);
@func f = z * x + r * log(y);
@plot(u,wait=true);
{  // new block
  @real r = 2; // not the same r
  @fespace Vh(Th,@P1);//  error because Vh is a global name
}  // end of block
//  here r back to 0.01
\eFF
\end{example}
The type declarations are  compulsory in \freefempp; in the end this feature is an asset because it is easy
to make bugs in a language with many implicit types. \index{variable} The
variable name is just an alphanumeric \index{alphanumeric} string, the
underscore character  ``\texttt{\_}'' is not allowed, because
it will be used as an operator in the future.\index{\_}

\subsection{List of major types}
\begin{description}
\item[bool]   is used for logical expression and flow-control.  The result of a
comparison is a boolean type as in
\bFF
bool fool=(1<2);
\eFF
which makes fool to be true.  Similar examples can be built with $==,<=,>=,<,>,!=$.
\index{bool}\index{true}\index{false}
\index{int}
\item[int]
  declares an integer.
\item[string] declare the variable to store
a text enclosed within double quotes, such as:
\bFF
"This is a string in double quotes."
\eFF
\index{string}
\item[real] declares the variable to store a number such as ``12.345''. \index{real}
\item[complex]  Complex numbers, such as\index{Complex}
$1+2i$, \freefempp understand that $i=\sqrt{-1}$.
\bFF
@complex a =  1@i, b = 2 + 3@i;
@cout << "a + b = " << a + b << @endl;
@cout << "a - b = " << a + b << @endl;
@cout << "a * b = " << a * b << @endl;
@cout << "a / b = " << a / b << @endl;
\eFF
Here's the output;
\bFF
a + b = (2,4)
a - b = (-2,-2)
a * b = (-3,2)
a / b = (0.230769,0.153846)
\eFF
\item[ofstream]  to declare an output file .
\item[ifstream]   to declare an input file .

\item[real[int]]  declares a variable that stores multiple
real numbers with integer index.

\subsection{Global Variables}\label{sec:Global}
 The names \ttCC{x,y,z,label,region,P,N,nu_triangle...} are reserved words used to link
the language to the finite element tools:

\subsection{System Commands}

Here is how to show all the types, and all the operator and functions of a \freefempp program:
\bFF
 @dumptable(@cout);
\eFF \index{dumptable}
To execute a system command in the string (not implemented on Carbon MacOS), which  return 
the value of the system call. 
\bFF
  @system("shell command"); // after version 3.12-1
  @exec("shell command");  
  
\eFF
This is useful to launch another executable from within \freefempp.
On MS-Windows, the full path of the executable. For example, if there is the command
``ls.exe'' in the subdirectory ``\verb|c:\cygwin\bin\|'', then we must write
\bFF
  @exec("c:\\cygwin\\bin\\ls.exe");
\eFF
\index{exec}

Another useful system command is \x{assert()} to make sure something is true.

\index{version}
\bFF
@assert(version>=1.40);
\eFF


\subsection{Arithmetics}
\paragraph{On integers}, $+,\, -,\, *$ are the usual arithmetic summation (plus),
subtraction (minus) and multiplication (times), respectively,The operators $/$ and $\%$ yield the quotient and the remainder from the division of the first expression by the second.
If the second number of $/$ or $\%$ is zero the behavior is undefined.
The \key{maximum} or \key{minimum} of two integers $a,\, b$ are obtained
by \texttt{max($a$,$b$)} or
\texttt{min($a$,$b$)}.
The power $a^b$ of two integers $a,\, b$ is calculated by writing \verb|a^b|.
The classical \texttt{C++}
"arithmetical if"  expression \ttCC{ a ? b : c} is equal to  the value of expression \ttCC{b} if
the value of expression  \ttCC{a} is true otherwise is equal to value of expression \ttCC{c}.
\index{?:}

\begin{example} Computations with the integers
\label{exm:int}
\bFF
@int a = 12, b = 5;
@cout <<"plus, minus of "<<a<<" and "<<b<<" are "<<a+b<<", "<<a-b<<@endl;
@cout <<"multiplication, quotient of them are "<<a*b<<", "<<a/b<<@endl;
@cout <<"remainder from division of "<<a<<" by "<<b<<" is "<<a%b<<@endl;
@cout <<"the minus of "<<a<<" is "<< -a << @endl;
@cout <<a<<" plus -"<<b<<" need bracket:"<<a<<"+(-"<<b<<")="<<a+(-b)<<@endl;
@cout <<"max and min of "<<a<<" and "<<b<<" is "<<@max(a,b)<<","<<@min(a,b)<< @endl;
@cout <<b<<"th power of "<<a<<" is "<<a^b<< @endl;
@cout << " min  == (a < b ? a : b )  is " << (a < b ? a : b) << @endl;

b=0;
@cout <<a<<"/0"<<" is "<< a/b << @endl;
@cout <<a<<"\%0"<<" is "<< a\%b << @endl;
\eFF
produce the following result:
\bFF
plus, minus of 12 and 5 are 17, 7
multiplication, quotient of them are 60, 2
remainder from division of 12 by 5 is 2
the minus of 12 is -12
12 plus -5 need bracket :12+(-5)=7
max and min of 12 and 5 is 12,5
5th power of 12 is 248832
min == (a < b ? a : b)   is 5
12/0 : long long long
Fatal error : ExecError  Div by 0 at exec line  9
Exec error : exit
\eFF
\end{example}

By the relation $integer\subset real$, the operators
``$+,\, -,\, *,\, /,\, \%$'' and ``\ttCC{@max,\, @min,\, \^}''
are extended to real numbers or variables. However,  $\%$
calculates the remainder of the integer parts of two real numbers.

The following are examples similar to Example \ref{exm:int}
\bFF
@real a=sqrt(2.), b = pi;
@cout <<"plus, minus of "<<a<<" and "<<pi<<" are "<< a+b <<", "<< a-b << @endl;
@cout <<"multiplication, quotient of them are "<<a*b<<", "<<a/b<< @endl;
@cout <<"remainder from division of "<<a<<" by "<<b<<" is "<< a%b << @endl;
@cout <<"the minus of "<<a<<" is "<< -a << @endl;
@cout <<a<<" plus -"<<b<<" need bracket :"<<a<<"+(-"<<b<<")="<<a + (-b) << @endl;
\eFF
It gives the following output:
\bFF
plus, minus of 1.41421 and 3.14159 are 4.55581, -1.72738
multiplication, quotient of them are 4.44288, 0.450158
remainder from division of 1.41421 by 3.14159 is 1
the minus of 1.41421 is -1.41421
1.41421 plus -3.14159 need bracket :1.41421+(-3.14159)=-1.72738
\eFF

By the relation
$$
bool\subset int \subset real\subset complex,
$$
the operators
``$+,\, -,\, *,\, /$'' and ``\ttCC{\^}'' are also applicable on complex-typed variables,
but ``\%,\, max, min'' cannot be used.
Complex numbers such as \texttt{5+9i},\, i$=\sqrt{-1}$, are valid expressions.
With real variables \texttt{a=2.45, b=5.33},complex numbers like
$a+i~b$ and $a+i\sqrt{2.0}$ must be declared by
\bFF
@complex z1 = a+b*1i, z2=a+@sqrt(2.0)*1i;
\eFF
The imaginary and real parts of a complex number \texttt{z} can be  obtained with
\ttCC{@imag} and \ttCC{@real}. \index{imag}\index{real}\index{complex}
\index{conj}
The conjugate of $a+bi$ ($a,b$ are reals) is defined by $a-bi$, which
can also be computed with the operator "conj",  by \ttCC{@conj(a+b*1i)} in \freefempp.

Internally the complex number $z=a+ib$ is considered as
the pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers $a,\, b$.
We can attach to it the point $(a,b)$ in the Cartesian plane where the $x$-axis is for the
 real part and the
$y$-axis for the imaginary part.
The same point $(a,b)$ has a representation with polar coordinate $(r,\phi)$,
So $z$ his also $z=r(\cos \phi+i\sin\phi )$,
$r=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ and $\phi=\tan^{-1}(b/a)$;
$r$ is called the \key{modulus} and $\phi$ the \key{argument} of $z$.
In the following example, we shall show them using \freefempp programming,
and \key{de Moivre's formula} $z^n=r^n(\cos n\phi+i\sin n\phi)$.

\index{polar}
\begin{example}~
\label{exm:complex}
\bFF
@real a=2.45, b=5.33;
@complex  z1=a+b*1i, z2 = a+sqrt(2.)*1i;
@func @string pc(@complex z) // printout complex to (real)+i(imaginary)
{
   @string r = "("+real(z);
   if (@imag(z)>=0) r = r+"+";
   @return r+@imag(z)+"i)";
}
// printout complex to |z|*(cos(arg(z))+i*sin(arg(z)))
@func @string toPolar(@complex z)
{
   @return @abs(z)+"*(cos("+@arg(z)+")+i*sin("+@arg(z)+"))";
}
cout <<"Standard output of the complex "<<pc(z1)<<" is the pair "
     <<z1<<endl;
cout <<"Plus, minus of "<<pc(z1)<<" and "<<pc(z2)<<" are "<< pc(z1+z2)
     <<", "<< pc(z1-z2) << endl;
cout <<"Multiplication, quotient of them are "<<pc(z1*z2)<<", "
     <<pc(z1/z2)<< endl;
cout <<"Real/imaginary part of "<<pc(z1)<<" is "<<@real(z1)<<", "

\eFF
Here's the output from Example \ref{exm:complex}
\bFF
Standard output of the complex (2.45+5.33i) is the pair (2.45,5.33)
Plus, minus of (2.45+5.33i) and (2.45+1.41421i) are (4.9+6.74421i), (0+3.91579i)
Multiplication, quotient of them are (-1.53526+16.5233i), (1.692+1.19883i)
Real/imaginary part of (2.45+5.33i) is 2.45, 5.33
Absolute of (2.45+5.33i) is 5.86612
(2.45+1.41421i) = 2.82887*(cos(0.523509)+i*sin(0.523509))
  and polar(2.82887,0.523509) = (2.45+1.41421i)
de Moivre's formula: (2.45+1.41421i)^3
                         = 22.638*(cos(1.57053)+i*sin(1.57053))
conjugate of (2.45+1.41421i) is (2.45-1.41421i)
(2.45+5.33i)^(2.45+1.41421i) is (8.37072-12.7078i)

returns the integral value nearest to x (according to
     the prevailing rounding mode) in floating-point format).\index{floor}\index{rint}\index{ceil}.

\itemtt[Elementary Functions] denotes for us  the class of functions presented above
(polynomials, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, circular) and
the functions obtained from those by the four arithmetic operations
\[
f(x)+g(x),\, f(x)-g(x),\, f(x)g(x),\, f(x)/g(x)
\]
and by composition $f(g(x))$, each applied a finite number of times.
In \freefempp,  all elementary functions can thus be created.
The derivative of an elementary function is also an elementary function;
however, the indefinite integral of an elementary function cannot always be expressed in terms of elementary functions.
\begin{example}
The following is an example
where an  elementary function is used to build the border of a domain.
\emph{Cardioid}
\bFF
@real b = 1.;
@real a = b;
@func @real phix(@real t)

\end{example}
Taking the principal value, we can define $\log z$ for $z\neq 0$ by
\[
\ln z = \ln |z|+i \arg z.
\]
Using \freefempp, we calculated
\ttCC{@exp(1+4i)}, \ttCC{@sin(pi+1i)}, \ttCC{@cos(pi/2-1i)} and \ttCC{@log(1+2i)}, we then have

\subsection{Functions of two Variables}
\label{sec:TwoVarFunctions}
\subsubsection{\setS{Formula}}
The general form of real functions of two independent variables $a,\, b$ is
usually written as $c=f(a,b)$. In \freefempp, \ttCC{x}, \ttCC{y}  and \ttCC{z} are
reserved word as explained in in Section \ref{sec:Global}.
So when the  two variables of the function are \ttCC{x} and \ttCC{y},
we may define the function without its argument, for example
\bFF
@func f=@cos(x)+@sin(y) ;
\eFF
Remark that the function type is given by the expression type.
The power operator can be used in functions such as
\ttCC{x\^{}1}, \ttCC{y\^{}0.23}.
In \ttCC{func}, we can write an elementary function as follows
\bFF
@func f = @sin(x)*@cos(y);
@func g = (x^2+3*y^2)*@exp(1-x^2-y^2);
@func h = @max(-0.5,0.1*@log(f^2+g^2));
\eFF

Complex valued function create functions with 2 variables \ttCC{x, y} as follows,
\bFF
@mesh Th=square(20,20,[-pi+2*pi*x,-pi+2*pi*y]); // $]-\pi,\pi[^2$
@fespace Vh(Th,P2);
@func z=x+y*1i;  // $z=x+iy$
@func f=@imag(sqrt(z));  // $f=\Im\sqrt{z}$
@func g=@abs( sin(z/10)*exp(z^2/10) ); // $g=|\sin z/10\exp z^2/10|$
Vh fh = f; plot(fh);  // contour lines of $f$
Vh gh = g; plot(gh);  // contour lines of $g$
\eFF
We call also construct \emph{elementary functions of two variables }
from elementary functions $f(x)$ or $g(y)$
by the four arithmetic operations
plus composition applied a finite number of times.

\subsubsection{\setS{FE-functions}}\index{FE-function}
Finite element functions are also constructed like elementary functions by an
arithmetic formula involving elementary functions.  The difference is that they are
evaluated at declaration time and \freefempp stores the array of its values at the places associated with he degree of freedom of the finite element type.  By opposition elementary functions are evaluated only when needed.
Hence FE-functions are not defined only by their formula but also by the mesh and the finite element which enter in their definitions.  If the value of a FE-function is requested at a point which is not a degree of freedom, an interpolation is used, leading to an interpolation error, while by contrast, an elementary function can be evaluated at any point exactly.

\bFF
func f=x^2*(1+y)^3+y^2;
mesh Th = square(20,20,[-2+2*x,-2+2*y]); // square $]-2,2[^2$
fespace Vh(Th,P1);
Vh fh=f;  // fh is the  projection of f to Vh (real value)
func zf=(x^2*(1+y)^3+y^2)*exp(x+1i*y);
Vh<complex> zh = zf; // zh is the projection of zf
// to complex value Vh space   \index{FE function!complex}
\eFF
The construction of \ttCC{fh} (=$f_h$) is explained in
\refSec{Finite Elements}.

\begin{note}
The command \ttCC{@plot} applies only for real or complex   FE-functions (2d or 3d) and not to elementary functions.
\end{note}

\subsection{Arrays}
\index{array}
An \emph{array} stores multiple objects, and
there are 2 kinds of arrays:
The first is similar to \emph{vector}, i.e. arrays with with \emph{integer indices}
and the second type is
arrays with \emph{string indices}.

In the first case, the size of the array
must be known at execution time, and implementation is done
with the \ttCC{KN<>} class and all the vector operator of
 \ttCC{KN<>} are implemented. For instance
\bFF
@real [int] tab(10), tab1(10); // 2 array of 10 real
@real [int] tab2;    //  bug array with no size
tab = 1.03;                //  set all the array to 1.03
tab[1]=2.15;
@cout << tab[1] << " " << tab[9] << " size of tab = "
     << tab.n << " min: " << tab.min << "  max:" << tab.max
     << " sum : "   << tab.sum <<   endl; //
tab.resize(12); //  change the size of array tab
  // to 12 with preserving first value
tab(10:11)=3.14; //  set unset value
@cout <<" resize tab: " <<  tab << endl;
@real [string] tt;
tt["+"]=1.5;
@cout<<tt["a"]<<"  "<<tt["+"]<<endl;
@real[int]  a(5),b(5),c(5),d(5);
a = 1;
b = 2;
c = 3;
a[2]=0;
d = ( a ? b : c ); // for i = 0, n-1  : d[i] = a[i] ? b[i] : c[i] ,
@cout << " d = ( a ? b : c )  is " << d << endl;
d = ( a ? 1 : c );// for i = 0, n-1: d[i] = a[i] ? 1 : c[i] ,  \hfill (v2.23-1)
d = ( a ? b : 0 );// for i = 0, n-1: d[i] = a[i] ? b[i] : 0 ,  \hfill (v2.23-1)
d = ( a ? 1 : 0 );// for i = 0, n-1: d[i] = a[i] ? 0 : 1 ,     \hfill (v2.23-1)
tab.sort ; //  sort the array tab  (version 2.18)
cout << " tab (after sort) "  << tab << endl;
int[int] ii(0:d.n-1); // set array ii to 0,1, ..., d.n-1 \hfill (v3.2)
d=-1:-5; // set d to  -1,-2, .. -5 \hfill (v3.2)

sort(d,ii); // sort array d and ii in parallel
cout << " d " << d << "\n ii = " << ii << endl;

Arrays can be set like in matlab or scilab with the operator \verb!::!, the
array generator of  \verb!a:c! is equivalent to \verb!a:1:c!, and the  array set by \verb!a:b:c!
is set to size  $ \lfloor |(b-a)/c|+1 \rfloor$  and the value $i$ is set by
$ a + i (b-a)/c$.

There are  \texttt{int,real, complex} arrays
with, in the third case, two operators (.in, .re) to generate the real and imaginary  real array  from the complex array
(without copy)
\index{re}\index{array!re}\index{im}\index{array!im}:

\bFF

\begin{note}
 Quantiles are points taken at regular intervals from the cumulative distribution function of a random variable. Here  the array values are random. \index{quantile}

 This  statisticial function \ttCC{a.quantile(q)} computes $v$ from an array $a$ of size $n$ for a
 given number $q\in ]0,1[$  such that
     $$ \#\{ i / a[i] < v \} \sim q*n   $$;
     it is equivalent to
     $  v = a[q*n]$   when the array $a$ is sorted.

\paragraph{Example of array with renumbering}    (version 2.3 or better) .
The renumbering is always given by an integer array, and if a value in the array
is negative, the mapping is not imaged, so the value is not set.

 \item \verb@./@ is the term to term divide operator. \index{./} \index{\string'} \index{product!term to term}
\end{itemize}
there are some compound operators also:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \verb@^-1@ is for  solving the linear system (example: \verb$ b = A^-1 x$) \index{solve!linear system}
 \item \verb@' *@ is the compound  of transposition and matrix product, so it is the dot product
(example \verb$real DotProduct=a'*b$) \index{dot product}\index{product!dot}, in complex case you get the Hermitian
product, so mathematically we have  \verb!a'*b!$ =  \overline{a}^T b $ \index{product! Hermitian dot}.
 \item \verb@ a*b'@ is the outer product  (example  \verb$matrix B=a'*b$ \index{outer product}\index{product!outer})
\end{itemize}

The resizing of a sparse matrix $A$ \index{resize}\index{matrix!resize} is also allowed:

Note that the new size can be greater or smaller than the previous size; all new term are set to
zero.

\subsubsection{Other arrays}

It is also possible to make an array of FE functions, with the same syntax,
and we can treat them as \emph{vector valued function} if we need them.
\index{array}\index{array!FE function}
\begin{example}
In the following example, Poisson's equation is solved for 3 different given
functions $f=1,\, \sin(\pi x)\cos(\pi y),\, |x-1||y-1|$, whose solutions are
stored in an array of FE function.
\bFF
@mesh Th=@square(20,20,[2*x,2*y]);
@fespace Vh(Th,P1);
Vh u, v, f;
@problem @Poisson(u,v) =
    @int2d(Th)( @dx(u)*@dx(v) + @dy(u)*@dy(v))
     + @int2d(Th)( -f*v ) + @on(1,2,3,4,u=0) ;
Vh[int] uu(3); // an array of FE function
f=1;   // problem1
Poisson; uu[0] = u;
f=sin(pi*x)*cos(pi*y);  // problem2
Poisson; uu[1] = u;
f=abs(x-1)*abs(y-1);    // problem3
Poisson; uu[2] = u;
@for (int i=0; i<3; i++)  // plots all solutions
  @plot(uu[i], @wait=true);
\eFF
\end{example}

 For the second case, it is just
 a map of the STL\footnote{Standard template Library, now part of standard \Cpp}\cite{cpp}
 so no  operations on vector are allowed,   except the
 selection of an item  . \index{dot product}\index{transpose}

The transpose or Hermitian conjugation operator is \texttt{\string'} as in  Matlab or Scilab, so the way
to compute the dot product of two array \ttCC{a,b} is  \ttCC{@real\ ab=\ a'*b}\index{product!dot}.
\index{min}\index{array!min}
\bFF
@int i;
@real [int] tab(10), tab1(10); // 2 array of 10 real
  \it  real [int] tab2;    //  Error: array with no size
tab = 1;                //  set all the array to 1
tab[1]=2;
@cout << tab[1] << " " << tab[9] << " size of tab = "
     << tab.n << " " << tab.min << " " << tab.max << " " <<  @endl;
tab1=tab; tab=tab+tab1; tab=2*tab+tab1*5; tab1=2*tab-tab1*5;
tab+=tab; @cout << " dot product " << tab'*tab << @endl; //${}^{t}{tab}\,{tab} $
@cout << tab << @endl; @cout << tab[1] << " "
<< tab[9] <<  @endl; @real[string] map;        //  a dynamic array
@for (i=0;i<10;i=i+1)
  {
    tab[i] = i*i;
    @cout << i << " " << tab[i] << "\n";
  };

map["1"]=2.0;
map[2]=3.0;             //  2 is automatically cast to the string "2"

@cout << " map[\"1\"] = " << map["1"] << "; "<< @endl;
@cout << " map[2] = " << map[2] << "; "<< @endl;
\eFF


\subsection{\setS{Loops}}

The \texttt{for} and \texttt{while}  loops are implemented in \freefempp together
with \texttt{break} and \texttt{continue} keywords.
\index{for}\index{while}
\index{break}\index{continue}

In for-loop, there are three parameters;
the INITIALIZATION of a control variable,
the CONDITION to continue,
the CHANGE of the control variable.
While \texttt{CONDITION} is true, for-loop continue.
\bFF
@for (INITIALIZATION; CONDITION; CHANGE)
     { BLOCK of calculations }
\eFF
An example below shows a sum from 1 to 10 with result is in \ttCC{sum},
\bFF
@int sum=0;
@for (@int i=1; i<=10; i++)
   sum += i;
\eFF
The while-loop
\bFF
@while (CONDITION) {
   BLOCK of calculations or change of control variables
}
\eFF
is executed repeatedly until CONDITION become false.
The sum from 1 to 10 can also be computed by \ttCC{@while} as follows,
\bFF
@int i=1, sum=0;
@while (i<=10) {
  sum += i; i++;
}
\eFF

We can exit from a loop in midstream by \ttCC{@break}.
The \ttCC{@continue} statement will pass the part from
\emph{continue} to the end of the loop.

\begin{example}~
\bFF
@for (@int i=0;i<10;i=i+1)
    @cout << i << "\n";
@real eps=1;
@while (eps>1e-5)
 { eps = eps/2;
   @if( i++ <100) @break;
   @cout << eps << @endl;}

@for (int j=0; j<20; j++) {
   @if (j<10) @continue;
   @cout << "j = " << j << @endl;
}
\eFF
\end{example}

\subsection{\setS{Input/Output}}
\index{cout}\index{cin}\index{ifstream}\index{ofstream}\index{endl}

The syntax of input/output statements is similar  to \Cpp syntax. It
uses \ttCC{@cout}, \ttCC{@cin}, \ttCC{@endl}, \ttCC{<<,>>}.

To write  to (resp. read from)  a file, \index{$<<$} \index{$>>$}\index{append}\index{ofstream!append}
declare a new variable \texttt{ofstream ofile("filename");} or \texttt{ofstream ofile("filename",append);} (resp.
\texttt{ifstream ifile("filename");} ) and use \texttt{ofile}  (resp. \texttt{ifile})
as \texttt{cout} (resp. \texttt{cin}).

The word \texttt{append} in  \texttt{ofstream ofile("filename",append);}
 means openning a file in append mode.

\begin{note} The file is closed
at the exit of the enclosing block,
\end{note}
\begin{example}~
\label{exm:io}
\bFF
@int i;
@cout << " std-out" << @endl;
@cout << " enter i= ? ";
@cin >> i ;
{
  @ofstream f("toto.txt");
  f << i << "coucou'\n";
}; //  close the file f because the variable f is delete

{
  @ifstream f("toto.txt");
   f >> i;
}
{
  @ofstream f("toto.txt",append);
     // to append to the existing file "toto.txt"
  f << i << "coucou'\n";
}; //  close the file f because the variable f is delete

  @cout << i << @endl;
\eFF



  

Some functions are available  to format the output.
\index{precision}\index{scientific}\index{fixed}\index{showbase}\index{noshowbase}\index{showpos}\index{noshowpos}\index{default}
\begin{itemize}
\item \ttCC{ int nold=f.@precision(n) } Sets the number of digits printed to the right of the decimal point. This applies to all subsequent floating point numbers written to that output stream. However, this won't make floating-point "integers" print with a decimal point. It's necessary to use fixed for that effect.
\item     \ttCC{f.@scientific}  Formats floating-point numbers in scientific notation (  \texttt{d.dddEdd} )
\item     \ttCC{f.@fixed}          Used fixed point notation (  \texttt{d.ddd} ) for floating-point numbers. Opposite of scientific.
\item     \ttCC{f.@showbase}    Converts insertions to an external form that can be read according to the C++ lexical conventions for integral constants. By default, showbase is not set.
\item     \ttCC{f.@noshowbase}   unset \texttt{showbase} flags
\item     \ttCC{f.@showpos}    inserts a plus sign (+) into a decimal conversion of a positive integral value.
\item     \ttCC{f.@noshowpos}  unset \texttt{showpos} flags
 \item   \ttCC{f.@default}     reset all  the previous  flags (\texttt{fmtflags}) to the  default expect precision.
\end{itemize}
Where \ttCC{f} is output stream descriptor, for example \texttt{cout}.

Remark, all these methods except the first return the stream \texttt{f}, so they can be chained as in
\bFF
    cout.scientific.showpos << 3 << endl;
\eFF

\subsubsection{\setS{Script arguments}}
There is a very useful predefined array in Freefem++ \texttt{ARGV} that contains all the arguments of the script used in the command line. The following code prints out the first three of these arguments:\index{ARGV} 
\bFF
//  version 3.8-1
@for(int i=0;i<ARGV.n;++i)
  {
    cout << ARGV[i] << endl;
  }
\eFF
\end{example}



And to get argument unused in \texttt{getARGV.idp} include script file, 
\bFF
@getARGV(n,defaultvalue) // get the nth parameter  unused if exist (n = 1, ...)
@getARGV(after,defaultvalue) // get the arg after the string after if exist
\eFF
The type of default value can be \texttt{int}, \texttt{real}, \texttt{string},
\subsection{preprocessor}\index{include}
The preprocessor handles directives for source file inclusion (\texttt{include} "script-name.idp"), macro definitions.

There are two types of macros, object-like and function-like. Object-like macros do not take parameters; function-like macros do. The generic syntax for declaring an identifier as a macro of each type is, respectively,
\bFF
@macro <identifier>@(@)  <replacement token list>  //EOM  a // comment  to end the macro
@macro <identifier>@(<parameter list>@) <replacement token list> //EOM 
\eFF

An example of macro without parameter 
\bFF
@macro xxx() {real i=0;int j=0;cout << i << " " << j << endl;}//
xxx \it/* replace xxx by the <replacement token list> */
\eFF
 The freefem++ code associated: 
\begin{verbatim}
    1 : // macro without parameter 
    2 :  macro xxx {real i=0;int j=0;cout << i << " " << j << endl;}//
    3 : 
    4 :             {real i=0;int j=0;cout << i << " " << j << endl;}
\end{verbatim}

An example of macro parameter \index{macro}\index{macro!quoting}

\bFF
@macro toto(i) i //
// quoting parameter the \{\} are remove
toto({real i=0;int j=0;cout << i << " " << j << endl;})
// and only one level of \{\} are remove 
toto({{real i=0;int j=0;cout << i << " " << j << endl;}})
\eFF
 The freefem++ code created :
\begin{verbatim}
    6 :  macro toto(i )   i // 
    8 : // quoting parameter the \{\} are remove
    9 :              real i=0;int j=0;cout << i << " " << j << endl; 
   10 : // and only one level of \{\} are remove 
   11 :              {real i=0;int j=0;cout << i << " " << j << endl;} 
\end{verbatim}

Use a  macro as parameter of macro \index{macro!parameter}
to transforme full matrix in formal array like in :

\bFF
@real[@int,@int] CC(7,7),EE(6,3),EEps(4,4);

	@macro VIL6(v,i) [ v(1,i), v(2,i),v(4,i), v(5,i),v(6,i) ]  //  EOM
	@macro VIL3(v,i) [ v(1,i), v(2,i) ]  //  EOM
	// apply v on array element : 
	@macro VV6(v,vv) [ v(vv,1), v(vv,2),
	 v(vv,4), v(vv,5), v(vv,6) ]  //  EOM
	@macro VV3(v,vv) [ v(vv,1), v(vv,2) ]  //  EOM  
// so formal matrix to build problem.. 
	@func C5x5 = VV6(VIL6,CC); 
	@func E5x2 = VV6(VIL3,EE);
	@func Eps =  VV3(VIL3,EEps);
\eFF
The freefem++ code created :
\begin{verbatim}
   16 : real[int,int] CC(7,7),EE(6,3),EEps(4,4);
   17 : 
   18 : 	 macro VIL6(v,i )   [ v(1,i), v(2,i),v(4,i), v(5,i),v(6,i) ]  //  EOM

 finally the operator \verb!#! to do concatenation of parameter:
 to build vectorial operation, like in
\bFF
@macro div(u) (dx(u#1)+ dy(u#2)) //EOM 
@mesh Th=square(2,2); fespace Vh(Th,P1);
Vh v1=x,v2=y;

The freefem++ code created :

   34 : cout << int2d(Th)(    (dx(v1)+ dy(v2)) ) << endl;

And to finish a amazing test to verified the quoting : \index{macro!quoting}
\bFF
@macro foo(i,j,k) i j k//EOM
foo(,,)  //  empty line
foo( {int [}, {int] a(10},{);}) 
\eFF
the result:
\begin{verbatim}

   37 :       //  empty line
   38 :         int [ int] a(10 );

To defined \texttt{macro} in a \texttt{macro} you can use 
the two new word \texttt{NewMacro} , \texttt{EndMacro} key word to set and
and claose de macro definition (version 3.11, and not well tested). 

\subsection{Exception handling}\index{exception}\index{catch}\index{try}

 In the version \texttt{2.3} of \texttt{FreeFem++}, exception handing was added as in \texttt{C++}.
 But today only the \texttt{C++} exceptions are caught. Note that  in \texttt{C++} all the errors attached to
\texttt{ExecError, assert, exit, ...} call exceptions  too so it may be hard to find the cause of the error.
 The exceptions handle all \texttt{ExecError}:



\begin{example} A simple example:    catch a  division by zero:
\bFF
@real a;
@try {
  a=1./0.;
}
@catch  (...) // in versions $>$ 2.3 all exceptions can be caught
{
  cout << " Catch an ExecError " << endl;
  a =0;
}
\eFF
\end{example}

The output is
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
1/0 : d d d
  current line = 3
Exec error :  Div by 0
   -- number :1
Try:: catch (...) exception
Catch an ExecError
\end{verbatim}
}

\begin{example}: a more realistic example with a none invertible matrix:
\bFF
@int nn=5        ;
@mesh Th=square(nn,nn);
@verbosity=5;
@fespace Vh(Th,P1);     // P1 FE space
Vh uh,vh;              // unkown and test function.
@func f=1;                 //  right hand side function
@func g=0;                 //  boundary condition function
@real   cpu=clock();
@problem laplace(uh,vh,solver=Cholesky,tolpivot=1e-6) =                    //  definion of  the problem
            int2d(Th)( dx(uh)*dx(vh) + dy(uh)*dy(vh) ) //  bilinear form
          + int2d(Th)( -f*vh )                          //  linear form
  ;

@try {
  cout << " Try Cholesky \n";
  laplace; // solve the problem 
  plot(uh); // to see the result
  cout << "-- lap Cholesky " << nn << "x" << nn << "  : " <<  -cpu+clock()
       << " s,  max =" << uh[].max << endl;
}
@catch(...) { // catch all
  @cout << " Catch cholesky PB " << endl;
}
\eFF
\end{example}
The output is
{\small

\section{\setS{Mesh Generation}}
\subsection{Commands for Mesh Generation}\label{sec:InitialMesh}
%In Step1 in Section \ref{sec:example}, the keywords
Let us begin with the two important keywords \texttt{\bf border} and \texttt{\bf buildmesh}
%square,
%,  movemesh ,
% adaptmesh, readmesh, trunc, triangulate, splitmesh, emptymesh}
%
%The following keywords are discussed in this section:
%
%\texttt{\bf square, border, buildmesh,  movemesh ,
% adaptmesh, readmesh, trunc, triangulate, splitmesh, emptymesh}
%
% \index{square}\index{border}\index{buildmesh}\index{movemesh}\index{adaptmesh}
% \index{readmesh}\index{triangulate}\index{splitmesh}\index{emptymesh}

All examples in this section come from the files \texttt{mesh.edp}
and \texttt{tablefunction.edp}.

\index{square}
\subsubsection{\setS{Square}}

The command``\texttt{\bf square}'' triangulates the unit square.
The following
\bFF
@mesh Th = @square(4,5);
\eFF
generates a $4\times 5$ grid in the unit square $[0,1]^2$. The labels of the boundaries
are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:square}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=6cm]{square}
\end{center}
  \caption{Boundary labels of the mesh by \texttt{square(10,10)}
  \label{fig:square}} \index{label}
\end{figure}
To construct a
$n\times m$ grid in the rectangle \index{rectangle} $[x_0,x_1]\times [y_0,y_1]$, proceeds as follows:
write
\bFF
  @real x0=1.2,x1=1.8;
  @real y0=0,y1=1;
  @int n=5,m=20;
  @mesh Th=@square(n,m,[x0+(x1-x0)*x,y0+(y1-y0)*y]);

\eFF

\begin{note}
Adding the  named  parameter \texttt{flags=icase} with icase:
\begin{description}
\item[0] will produce a mesh where all quads are split with diagonal $ x-y=cte$
\item[1] will produce Union Jack flag type of mesh.
\item[2] will produce a mesh where all quads are split with diagonal $ x+y=cte$ (v 3.8)
\item[3] same as case 0  except in two corners such that no triangle with 3 vertices on boundary (v 3.8)
\item[4] same as case 2  except in two corners such that no triangle with 3 vertices on boundary (v 3.8)
\end{description}\index{square!flags=}\index{square!label=}\index{square!region=}
\bFF
  @mesh Th=@square(n,m,[x0+(x1-x0)*x,y0+(y1-y0)*y],flags=icase);
\eFF
Adding the  named  parameter \texttt{label=labs} will change the 4 default
label numbers to \texttt{labs[i-1]}, for example \texttt{int[int] labs=[11,12,13,14]},

and adding the  named parameter \texttt{region=10} will change  the region number  to $10$,  for instance (v 3.8).

To see all these fags at work,  try the file \texttt{examples++/square-mesh.edp} :
\bFF
@for (@int i=0;i<5;++i)
  {
    @int[@int] labs=[11,12,13,14];
    @mesh Th=square(3,3,flags=i,label=labs,region=10);
    @plot(Th,wait=1,cmm=" square flags = "+i );
   }
\eFF

\end{note}


\subsubsection{\setS{Border}}\index{border}\index{label}

Boundaries are defined piecewise by parametrized curves.
The pieces can only intersect at their endpoints, but it is possible to 
join more than two endpoints. This can be used to structure the mesh
if an area thouches a border and create new regions by dividing larger ones:
\bFF
@int upper = 1;
@int others = 2;
@int inner = 3;

@border C01(t=0,1){x = 0;         y = -1+t;        label = upper;}
@border C02(t=0,1){x = 1.5-1.5*t; y = -1;          label = upper;}
@border C03(t=0,1){x = 1.5;       y = -t;          label = upper;}
@border C04(t=0,1){x = 1+0.5*t;   y = 0;           label = others;}
@border C05(t=0,1){x = 0.5+0.5*t; y = 0;           label = others;}
@border C06(t=0,1){x = 0.5*t;     y = 0;           label = others;}
@border C11(t=0,1){x = 0.5;       y = -0.5*t;      label = inner;}
@border C12(t=0,1){x = 0.5+0.5*t; y = -0.5;        label = inner;}
@border C13(t=0,1){x = 1;         y = -0.5+0.5*t;  label = inner;}

@int n = 10;
@plot(C01(-n)+C02(-n)+C03(-n)+C04(-n)+C05(-n)+C06(-n)+
      C11(n)+C12(n)+C13(n), wait=true);

@mesh Th = buildmesh(C01(-n)+C02(-n)+C03(-n)+C04(-n)+C05(-n)+C06(-n)+
      C11(n)+C12(n)+C13(n));

@plot(Th, wait=true); // figure \ref{multiendmesh}

@cout << "Part 1 has region number " << Th(0.75, -0.25).region << endl;
@cout << "Part 2 has redion number " << Th(0.25, -0.25).region << endl;
\eFF

Triangulation keywords assume that the domain is defined as being on the \emph{left} (resp right) of its
oriented parameterized boundary
$$
\Gamma_j=\{(x,y)\left|\; x=\varphi_x(t),\, y=\varphi_y(t),\, a_j\le t\le b_j\right.\}
$$
To check the orientation plot
$t\mapsto (\varphi_x(t),\varphi_y(t)),\, t_0\le t\le t_1$.
If it is as in Fig. \ref{fig:border}, then
the domain lies on the shaded area, otherwise it lies on the opposite side


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[height=4cm]{border}
\end{center}
  \caption{Orientation of the boundary defined by $(\phi_x(t),\phi_y(t))$
  \label{fig:border}} \index{border}
\end{figure}
The general expression to define a triangulation with \texttt{buildmesh} is
\begin{center}
\ttCC{@mesh  ~~Mesh_Name = @buildmesh}$\left(\Gamma_1(m_1)+\cdots+\Gamma_J(m_j) \mathrm{~OptionalParameter} \right)$;
\end{center}
where $m_j$ are positive or negative numbers to indicate how many vertices should be on $\Gamma_j,\,
\Gamma=\cup_{j=1}^J \Gamma_J$, and the optional parameter (separed with comma) can be
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{nbvx=<int value>}] ,  to set the maximal number of  vertices in the mesh.\index{buildmesh!nbvx=}
\index{buildmesh!fixeborder=}
\item[\texttt{fixeborder=<bool value>}] , to say if the mesh generator can change the boundary mesh
or not (by default the boundary mesh can change; beware that with periodic boundary conditions 
(see. \ref{periodic BC}), it can be dangerous .\label{buildmesh fixeborder}\index{buildmesh!fixeborder}
\end{description}

The orientation of boundaries can be changed by changing the sign of $m_j$.
The following example shows how to change the orientation.
The example generates the unit disk
with a small circular hole, and assign ``1'' to the unit disk
(``2'' to the circle inside).
The boundary label must be non-zero, but it can also be omitted.

\bFF
1: @border a(t=0,2*pi){ x=cos(t); y=sin(t);label=1;}
2: @border b(t=0,2*pi){ x=0.3+0.3*cos(t); y=0.3*sin(t);label=2;}
3: @plot(a(50)+b(+30)) ; // to see a plot of the border mesh \index{plot!border}
4: @mesh Thwithouthole= @buildmesh(a(50)+b(+30));
5: @mesh Thwithhole   = @buildmesh(a(50)+b(-30));
6: @plot(Thwithouthole,wait=1,ps="Thwithouthole.eps"); //figure \ref{Thwithouthole}\index{plot!mesh}
7: @plot(Thwithhole,wait=1,ps="Thwithhole.eps"); // figure \ref{Thwithhole}
\eFF
\begin{note}
Notice that the orientation is changed by ``\texttt{b(-30)}'' in 5th line. In 7th line, \texttt{ps="fileName"} is used to generate a postscript file with identification shown on the figure.
\end{note}

\twoplot[height=6cm]{Thwithouthole}{Thwithhole}{mesh without hole}{mesh with hole}

\begin{note}
 Borders are evaluated only at the time \texttt{plot} or \texttt{buildmesh} is called  so
the global variable are defined  at this time andhere since $r$ is changed between the two border calls the following code will not work because the first border will be computed with r=0.3:
\bFF
   @real r=1;    @border a(t=0,2*pi){ x=r*cos(t); y=r*sin(t);label=1;}
   r=0.3    ;   @border b(t=0,2*pi){ x=r*cos(t); y=r*sin(t);label=1;}
   @mesh Thwithhole   = @buildmesh(a(50)+b(-30)); // bug (a trap) because
   // the two circle have the same radius = $0.3$
\eFF
\end{note}


\subsubsection{Data Structures and Read/Write Statements for a Mesh}

\index{readmesh}\index{savemesh}
Users who want to read a triangulation made elsewhere should see the structure
of the file generated below:
\bFF
@border C(t=0,2*pi) { x=cos(t); y=sin(t); }
@mesh Th = @buildmesh(C(10));
@savemesh("mesh_sample.msh");
\eFF
the mesh is shown on Fig. \ref{fig:meshSample}.
\\\\
The informations about \texttt{Th} are saved in the file ``mesh\_sample.msh''.
whose structure is shown on Table \ref{tab:meshSample}.
\\
There $n_v$ denotes
the number of vertices, $n_t$ number of triangles
and $n_s$ the number of edges on boundary.

For each vertex $q^i,\, i=1,\cdots,n_v$, denote   by $(q^i_x,q^i_y)$
the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate.

Each triangle $T_k, k=1,\cdots,10$ has three vertices $q^{k_1},\, q^{k_2},\,q^{k_3}$
that are oriented counterclockwise.
The boundary consists of 10 lines $L_i,\, i=1,\cdots,10$ whose end points are
$q^{i_1},\, q^{i_2}$.

In \freefempp there are many mesh file formats available for communication with
other tools such as emc2, modulef.. (see \refSec{Mesh Files}),
The extension of a file implies its format. More details can be found on the file format .msh in the article by F. Hecht
"bamg : a bidimentional anisotropic mesh generator" (downloadable  from the
FreeFem web site. ) 
\\\\
 A
mesh file can be read into \freefempp except that the names of the
borders are lost and only their reference numbers are kept. So these borders have to be referenced by the number
which corresponds to their order of appearance in the program, unless
this number is overwritten by the keyword "label".  Here are some examples:

\bFF
@border floor(t=0,1){ x=t; y=0; label=1;}; // the unit square
@border right(t=0,1){ x=1; y=t; label=5;};
@border ceiling(t=1,0){ x=t; y=1; label=5;};
@border left(t=1,0){ x=0; y=t; label=5;};
@int n=10;
@mesh th= buildmesh(floor(n)+right(n)+ceiling(n)+left(n));
@savemesh(th,"toto.am_fmt");  // "formatted Marrocco" format \index{file!am\_fmt}
@savemesh(th,"toto.Th");      // "bamg"-type mesh   \index{file!bamg}
@savemesh(th,"toto.msh");     // freefem format \index{file!mesh}
@savemesh(th,"toto.nopo");     // modulef format \index{file!nopo} see \cite{modulef}
@mesh th2 = readmesh("toto.msh"); // read the mesh

\subsubsection{The keyword "triangulate"}\index{triangulate}

\freefempp is able to build a triangulation from a set of points. This
triangulation is a Delaunay mesh of the convex hull of the set of points.
It can be useful to build a mesh form a table function.

The coordinates of the points and the value of the table function
are defined separately with rows of the form: \texttt{x y f(x,y)}
in a file such as:

\bFF
0.51387 0.175741 0.636237
0.308652 0.534534 0.746765

...............
\eFF
%%% Thxy.eps not found
\twoplot[height=4cm]{Thxy}{xyf}{Delaunay mesh of the convex hull of point set in file xyf}
{Isovalue of table function}

The third column of each line is left untouched by the
\texttt{triangulate} command. But you can use this third value to
define a table function with rows of the form: \texttt{x y f(x,y)}.


The following example shows how to make a mesh from the file ``xyf''
with the format stated just above.
The command
\texttt{triangulate} command use only use 1st and 2nd rows.

\index{function!tables}

\bFF
@mesh Thxy=@triangulate("xyf"); // build the Delaunay mesh of the convex hull
// points are defined by the first 2 columns of file \texttt{xyf}
@plot(Thxy,ps="Thxyf.ps"); // (see figure  \ref{Thxy})

@fespace Vhxy(Thxy,P1); // create a P1 interpolation
Vhxy fxy; // the function

// reading the 3rd row to define the function
{ @ifstream file("xyf");
   @real xx,yy;
   @for(@int i=0;i<fxy.n;i++)
   file >> xx >>yy >> fxy[][i];  // to read third row only.
   // xx and yy are just skipped
}
@plot(fxu,ps="xyf.eps"); // plot the function (see figure  \ref{xyf})
\eFF

One  new way to build a mesh is to have two arrays one  the $x$ values and the other for the $y$ values (version 2.23-2):
\bFF
Vhxy xx=x,yy=y;// to set two arrays for the x's and y's
@mesh Th=@triangulate(xx[],yy[]);

\subsection{Boundary FEM Spaces Built as Empty Meshes}\index{emptymesh}
To define a Finite Element space on a boundary,
we came up with the idea of a mesh with no internal points (call empty mesh).
It can be useful to handle Lagrange multipliers in mixed and mortar methods.

So the function \texttt{emptymesh} remove all the internal points of a mesh except
points  on  internal boundaries.

\bFF
{  //  new stuff 2004 emptymesh (version 1.40)
 // -- useful to build Multiplicator space
 //  build a mesh without internal point
 // with the same boundary
 //  -----
  assert(version>=1.40);
  @border a(t=0,2*pi){ x=cos(t); y=sin(t);label=1;}
  @mesh Th=buildmesh(a(20));
   Th=@emptymesh(Th);
  @plot(Th,wait=1,ps="emptymesh-1.eps");//see figure \ref{fig emptymesh-1}
}
\eFF

It is also possible to build an empty mesh of a pseudo subregion
with \texttt{emptymesh(Th,ssd)} using the set of edges of the mesh \texttt{Th};
a edge $e$ is in  this set  if with the two adjacent triangles $e =t1\cap t2$
and  $ ssd[T1] \neq ssd[T2]$ where \texttt{ssd}  refers to the pseudo region
numbering of triangles, when they are stored in an \texttt{int[int]} array of size the number of triangles.
\bFF

\subsection{Remeshing}
\subsubsection{\setS{Movemesh}}\index{movemesh}\index{checkmovemesh}

Meshes can be translated, rotated and deformed by {\tt movemesh}; this is useful for
 elasticity to watch the deformation due to the displacement
$\vec\Phi(x,y)=(\Phi_1(x,y),\Phi_2(x,y))$ of shape. It is also useful to
handle free boundary  problems or optimal shape problems.

If $\Omega$ is triangulated as $T_h(\Omega)$,
and $\Phi$ is a displacement vector then $\Phi(T_h)$ is obtained by
\bFF
@mesh  Th=@movemesh(Th,[$\Phi$1,$\Phi$2]);
\eFF
Sometimes the transformed mesh is invalid because some triangle
have flip over (now has negative area).To spot such problems one may check the
minimum triangle area in the transformed mesh with
\texttt{checkmovemesh} before any real transformation.

\begin{example} $\Phi_1(x,y)=x+k*\sin(y*\pi)/10)$,
$\Phi_2(x,y)=y+k*\cos(y\pi)/10)$ for a big number $k>1$.

\begin{note}
Consider a function $u$ defined on a mesh \texttt{Th}. A statement like
\texttt{Th=movemesh(Th...)} does not change $u$ and so the old mesh
still exists. It will be destroyed when no function use it. A
statement like $u=u$ redefines $u$ on the new mesh \texttt{Th} with
interpolation and therefore destroys the old \texttt{Th} if $u$ was the only
function using it.
\end{note}

\begin{example}[movemesh.edp]

 @real minarea=checkmovemesh(Th,[x,y+f]);

\subsection{\setS{Regular Triangulation}: {\tt hTriangle}}
For a set $S$, we define the diameter of $S$ by
\[
\textrm{diam}(S)=\sup\{|\vec{x}-\vec{y}|; \; \vec{x},\, \vec{y}\in S\}
\]
The sequence $\{\mathcal{T}_h\}_{h\downarrow 0}$ of $\Omega$ is called
\emph{regular}\index{mesh!regular} if they satisfy the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
\[
\lim_{h\downarrow 0}\max\{\textrm{diam}(T_k)|\; T_k\in \mathcal{T}_h\}=0
\]
  \item
There is a number $\sigma>0$ independent of $h$ such that
\[
\frac{\rho(T_k)}{\textrm{diam}(T_k)}\ge \sigma
\qquad \textrm{for all }T_k\in \mathcal{T}_h
\]
where $\rho(T_k)$ are the diameter of the inscribed circle of $T_k$.
\end{enumerate}
We put $h(\mathcal{T}_h)=\max\{\textrm{diam}(T_k)|\; T_k\in \mathcal{T}_h\}$,
which is obtained by

f(x,y) = 10.0x^3+y^3+\tan^{-1}[\varepsilon/(\sin(5.0y)-2.0x)]

\]
sharply varies in value and the initial mesh given by one of the commands of Section \ref{sec:InitialMesh}
cannot reflect its sharp variations.
\begin{example}~

Mesh adaptation is a very powerful tool when the solution of a problem
varies locally and sharply.

Here we solve the problem (\ref{eqn:Poisson})-(\ref{eqn:Dirichlet}),
when $f=1$ and $\Omega$ is a L-shape domain.

\end{example}
To speed up the adaptation
the default parameter \texttt{err} of
\texttt{adaptmesh}\index{concatenation} is changed by hand; it
specifies the required precision, so as to make the new mesh finer or coarser.

The problem is coercive and symmetric,
so the linear system can be solved with the conjugate gradient
method \index{solver=!CG} (parameter \texttt{solver=CG}
with the stopping criteria on the residual, here
\texttt{eps=1.0e-6}).
By \texttt{adaptmesh}, the slope of the final solution is correctly computed near
the point of intersection of $bc$ and $bd$ as in Fig. \ref{lshapeSol}.

This method is described in detail in \cite{bamg}. It has a number of
default parameters which can be modified~:

\index{adaptmesh}

Si \texttt{f1,f2} sont des functions  et \texttt{thold, Thnew} des maillages.

\eFF
The additional paramters of  adaptmesh not written here, hence the  "..."
\begin{description}

    \item[\texttt{hmin=}] Minimum edge size.  \index{adaptmesh!hmin=}
    ({\tt val} is a real. Its default is related to
    the size of the domain to be meshed and the precision of the mesh
    generator).

    \item[\texttt{hmax=}] Maximum edge size.  ({\tt val} is a real.
    It defaults to the diameter of the domain to be
    meshed) \index{adaptmesh!hmax=}

    \item[\texttt{err=}] $P_1$ interpolation error level (0.01 is the
    default).  \index{adaptmesh!err=}

    \item[\texttt{errg=}] Relative geometrical error. By default this
    error is 0.01, and in any case it must be lower than $1/\sqrt{2}$.
    Meshes created with this option may have some edges smaller than
    the {\tt -hmin } due to geometrical constraints.
    \index{adaptmesh!errg=}

    \item[\texttt{nbvx=}] Maximum number of vertices generated by the
    mesh generator (9000 is the default).
    \index{adaptmesh!nbvx=}

    \item[\texttt{nbsmooth=}] number of iterations of the smoothing
    procedure (5 is the default).  \index{adaptmesh!nbsmooth=}

    \item[\texttt{nbjacoby=}] number of iterations in a smoothing
    procedure during the metric construction, 0 means no smoothing (6
    is the default).  \index{adaptmesh!nbjacoby=}

    \item[\texttt{ratio=}] ratio for a prescribed smoothing on the
    metric.  If the value is 0 or less than 1.1 no smoothing is done
    on the metric (1.8 is the default).

    If \texttt{ratio} $> 1.1$, the speed of mesh size variations is
    bounded by $log(\mathtt{ratio})$.  Note: As {\tt ratio} gets
    closer to {\tt 1}, the number of generated vertices increases.
    This may be useful to control the thickness of refined regions
    near shocks or boundary layers .  \index{adaptmesh!ratio=}

   \item[\texttt{omega=}] relaxation parameter for the smoothing
   procedure (1.0 is the default).  \index{adaptmesh!omega=}

    \item[\texttt{iso=}] If true, forces the metric to be isotropic
    (false is the default).  \index{adaptmesh!iso=}

    \item[\texttt{abserror=}] If false, the metric is evaluated using
    the criterium of equi-repartion of relative error (false is the
    default).  In this case the metric is defined by

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M} = \left({1\over\mathtt{err}\,\, \mathtt{coef}^2} \quad {
  |\mathcal{H}| \over max(\mathtt{CutOff},|\eta|)}\right)^p
  \label{eq err rel}
\end{equation}
    \index{adaptmesh!abserror=}

    otherwise, the metric is evaluated using the criterium of
    equi-distribution of errors.  In this case the metric is defined
    by

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M} = \left({1\over \mathtt{err}\,\,\mathtt{coef}^2} \quad
  {|{\mathcal{H}|} \over

\end{equation}

    \item[\texttt{cutoff=}] lower limit for the relative error
    evaluation (1.0e-6 is the default).
    \index{adaptmesh!cutoff=}

    \item[\texttt{verbosity=}] informational messages level (can be
    chosen between 0 and $\infty$). Also changes the value of the
    global variable verbosity (obsolete).  \index{adaptmesh!verbosity=}

    \item[\texttt{inquire=}] To inquire graphically about the mesh (false is the
    default).  \index{adaptmesh!inquire=}

    \item[\texttt{splitpbedge=}] If true, splits all internal edges in
    half with two boundary vertices (true is the default).
    \index{adaptmesh!splitpbedge=}

    \item[\texttt{maxsubdiv=}] Changes the metric such that the
    maximum subdivision of a background edge is bound by {\tt val}
    (always limited by 10, and 10 is also the default).
    \index{adaptmesh!maxsubdiv=}

    \item[\texttt{rescaling=}] if true, the function with respect to
    which the mesh is adapted is rescaled to be between 0 and 1 (true
    is the default).  \index{adaptmesh!rescaling=}

    \item[\texttt{keepbackvertices=}] if true, tries to keep as many
    vertices from the original mesh as possible (true is the default).
    \index{adaptmesh!keepbackvertices=}

    \item[\texttt{isMetric=}] if true, the metric is defined
    explicitly (false is the default).  If the 3 functions $m_{11},
    m_{12}, m_{22}$ are given, they directly define a symmetric matrix
    field whose Hessian is computed to define a metric. If only one
    function is given, then it represents the isotropic mesh size at
    every point.  \index{adaptmesh!IsMetric=}

    For example, if the partial derivatives
    \texttt{fxx} ($=\p^2 f/\p x^2$),
    \texttt{fxy} ($=\p^2 f/\p x\p y$),
    \texttt{fyy} ($=\p^2 f/\p y^2$) are given, we can set
    $$
    \ttCC{Th=@adaptmesh(Th,fxx,fxy,fyy,IsMetric=1,nbvx=10000,hmin=hmin);}
    $$

    \item[\texttt{power=}] exponent power of the Hessian used to
    compute the metric (1 is the default).  \index{adaptmesh!powerin=}

\index{adaptmesh!thetamax=}
    \item[\texttt{thetamax=}] minimum corner  angle of in degrees (default
    is $10^\circ$) where the corner is $ABC$ and the angle is the angle of the two vectors  ${AB}, {BC}$, 
    ($0$ imply no corner, $90$ imply perp. corner , ...). 

    \item[\texttt{splitin2=}] boolean value. If true, splits all
    triangles of the final mesh into 4
    sub-triangles. \index{adaptmesh!splitin2=}

    \item[\texttt{metric=}] \index{adaptmesh!metric=} an array of 3
    real arrays to set or get metric data information. The size of
    these three arrays must be the number of vertices. So if
    \texttt{m11,m12,m22} are three P1 finite elements related to the
    mesh to adapt, you can write: \texttt{metric=[m11[],m12[],m22[]]}
    (see file convect-apt.edp for a full example)

    \itemtt[nomeshgeneration=] \index{adaptmesh!nomeshgeneration=} If
    true, no adapted mesh is generated (useful to compute only a
    metric).

    \itemtt[periodic=] \index{adaptmesh!periodic=} %%% modif FH
    Writing \texttt{periodic=[[4,y],[2,y],[1,x],[3,x]];}
    builds an adapted periodic mesh. The sample

    (see periodic finite element   spaces \ref{periodic BC}, and see \texttt{sphere.edp} for a  full example)
\end{description}

%%%alh proofreading ok up to here


 We can use the command \ttCC{adaptmesh} to build uniform mesh with a
 contant mesh size. \index{mesh!uniform}\index{adaptmesh!uniform}

 So to build a mesh with a constant mesh size equal to $\frac{1}{30}$ try:

\begin{example}{uniformmesh.edp} 
\bFF
@mesh Th=square(2,2); // to have initial mesh
plot(Th,wait=1,ps="square-0.eps");
Th= @adaptmesh(Th,1./3As writing
0.,IsMetric=1,nbvx=10000);// \index{mesh!uniform}
plot(Th,wait=1,ps="square-1.eps");
Th= @adaptmesh(Th,1./30.,IsMetric=1,nbvx=10000);//  more the one time du to
Th= @adaptmesh(Th,1./30.,IsMetric=1,nbvx=10000);//  adaptation  bound \texttt{maxsubdiv=}
plot(Th,wait=1,ps="square-2.eps");
\eFF
\threeplot[width=5cm]%
{square-0}{Initial mesh}%
{square-1}{first iteration}%
{square-2}{last iteration}%
\end{example}

\subsection{Trunc}\index{trunc}

Two operators have been introduce to remove triangles from a mesh or to divide them.
Operator {\tt trunc } has two parameters
% FFCS(8/10/9)need to move index for htindex not to interfere
% with \begin{description}
\index{split=} \index{label=}\index{trunc!split=} \index{trunc!label=}
\begin{description}
  \itemtt[label=] sets the label number of new boundary item (one by default)
  \itemtt[split=] sets the level $n$ of triangle splitting. each triangle is splitted in  $n\times n$ ( one by default).
\end{description}

To create the mesh \texttt{Th3}
where alls  triangles of a mesh \texttt{Th}  are splitted in $3{\times}3$ , just write:
\bFF
  mesh Th3 = trunc(Th,1,split=3);
\eFF

The  \texttt{truncmesh.edp} example construct
all "trunc" mesh  to the support of the basic function  of the space \texttt{Vh} (cf. \texttt{abs(u)>0}),
split all the  triangles in $5{\times} 5$, and put a label number to $2$ on new boundary.
\bFF
@mesh Th=square(3,3);
@fespace Vh(Th,P1);
Vh u;
@int i,n=u.n;
u=0;
@for (i=0;i<n;i++)  // all degree of freedom
 {
  u[][i]=1;        //  the basic function i
  @plot(u,wait=1);
  @mesh Sh1=trunc(Th,abs(u)>1.e-10,split=5,label=2);
  plot(Th,Sh1,wait=1,ps="trunc"+i+".eps");// plot the mesh of
  // the function's support
  u[][i]=0;      // reset
 }
\eFF
\twoplot[height=6cm]{trunc0}{trunc6}{ mesh of support the function P1  number 0, splitted in $5{\times}5$ }{
mesh of support the function P1  number 6, splitted in $5{\times}5$ }
\index{splitmesh}
\subsection{Splitmesh}
Another way to split mesh triangles is to use {\tt splitmesh}, for example:
\bFF
{  //  new stuff 2004 splitmesh (version 1.37)
  assert(version>=1.37);
  @border a(t=0,2*pi){ x=cos(t); y=sin(t);label=1;}
  @mesh Th=@buildmesh(a(20));
  @plot(Th,wait=1,ps="nosplitmesh.eps"); // see figure \ref{fig nosplitmesh}
  @Th=@splitmesh(Th,1+5*(square(x-0.5)+y*y));
  @plot(Th,wait=1,ps="splitmesh.eps"); // see figure \ref{fig splitmesh}
}
\eFF

\twoplot[height=6cm]{nosplitmesh}{splitmesh}{\label{fig nosplitmesh}initial mesh}{\label{fig splitmesh}all left mesh triangle is split  conformaly in \texttt{int(1+5*(square(x-0.5)+y*y)\^2} triangles.}

\subsection{How to change the label of elements and border elements of a mesh}
\label{sec.changelab.gluemesh}
Changing the label of elements and border elements will be done using the keyword {\bf{change}}. The parameters for this
command line are for a two dimensional and dimensional case:
\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{label =}] is a vector of integer that contains successive pair of the old label number to  the new label number .
\item [\texttt{region =}] is a vector of integer that contains successive pair of the old region number to new region number.
\end{description}
%and for a three dimensional case:
%\begin{description}
%\item [\texttt{region =}] is a vector of integer that contains the old region number at index $2i$ and the new region number at index  $2i+1$ of tetrahedra.
%\item [\texttt{label =}] is a vector of integer that contains the old labels number at index $2i$ and the new labels number at index $2i+1$ of traingles.
%\end{description}

These vectors are composed of $n_{l}$ successive pair of number $O,N$  where $n_{l}$ is the number (label or region)
that we want to change.
For example, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq.org.vector.change.label}
\mathtt{label} &= &[ O_{1}, N_{1},  ..., O_{n_{l}},N_{n_{l}} ] \\
\mathtt{region} & =& [ O_{1}, N_{1},  ..., O_{n_{l}},N_{n_{l}} ]
\end{eqnarray}

%%%ALH-25/2/10-compilation error
%%%where $O_{i}$ is the $i^\mathrm{nd}$ old number (label or region) to change in new number $N_{i}$.

An example of using this function is given in "glumesh2D.edp":  \index{mesh!change}\index{change}

\subsection{Mesh in three dimensions}

\subsubsection{Read/Write Statements for a Mesh in 3D}
\index{readmesh}\index{savemesh}

In three dimensions, the file mesh format supported for input and output files by FreeFem++ are the extension .msh and .mesh.
These formats are described in the chapter on Mesh Files in two dimensions.

\paragraph{extension file .msh}
The structure of the files with extension .msh in 3D is given in Table \ref{tab:mesh3DSample}.
In this structure, $n_v$ denotes the number of vertices, $n_{tet}$ the number of tetrahedra and $n_{tri}$ the number of triangles
For each vertex $q^i,\, i=1,\cdots,n_v$, we denote by $(q^i_x,q^i_y,q^i_z)$ the $x$-coordinate, the $y$-coordinate and the $z$-coordinate.

\subsubsection{TeGen: A tetrahedral mesh generator }

\paragraph{TetGen}

TetGen is a software developed by Dr. Hang Si of Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics of
Berlin in Germany \cite{tetgen}. TetGen is a free for research and non-commercial uses. For any commercial
licence utilization, a commercial licence is available upon request to Hang Si.

This software is a tetrahedral mesh generator of a three dimensional domain defined by its boundary.
The input domain take into account a polyhedral or a piecewise linear complex.
This tetrahedralization is a constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization.

The method used in TetGen to control the quality of the mesh is a Delaunay refinement due to 
Shewchuk \cite{tetgenshewchuk}. The quality measure of this algorithm is the Radius-Edge
Ratio (see Section 1.3.1 \cite{tetgen} for more details). A theoretical bounds of this ratio of the algorithm
of Shewchuk is obtained for a given complex of vertices, constrained segments and facets of surface mesh,
with no input angle less than 90 degree. This theoretical bounds is 2.0.\\

The attribute and the volume constraint of region are given in this real vector of size $5\times \texttt{nbofregions}$.
The $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ region is described by five elements: $x-$coordinate, $y-$coordinate and $z-$coordinate of
a point inside this domain ($x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}$); the attribute ($at_{i}$) and the maximum volume for tetrahedra ($mvol_{i}$) for this region.
The \texttt{regionlist} vector is: $x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}, at_{1}, mvol_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}, at_{2}, mvol_{2}, \cdots  $.

Principal switch parameters in TetGen:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

To obtain a tetrahedral mesh generator with tetgen, we need the surface mesh of three dimensional domain.
We give now the command line in FreeFem++ to construct these meshes.

\index{movemesh23}
\paragraph{keyword: ``movemesh23''}

\index{mesh3}
A simple method to construct a surface is to place a two dimensional domain in a three dimensional space.
This corresponding to move the domain by a displacement vector of this form $\Phi(x,y) = ( \Phi1(x,y), \Phi2(x,y), \Phi3(x,y) )$.
The result of moving a two dimensional mesh Th2 by this three dimensional displacement is obtained using:

\bFF
@mesh3 Th3 = @movemesh23(Th2,transfo=[$\Phi$1,$\Phi$2,$\Phi$3]);
\eFF

The parameters of this command line are:
\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{transfo   =}] \texttt{[$\Phi$1, $\Phi$2, $\Phi$3]} set the displacement vector of transformation $\Phi(x,y) = [\Phi1(x,y), \Phi2(x,y), \Phi3(x,y) ]$.
\index{movemesh23!transfo=}
\item [\texttt{label   =}] set integer label of triangles
\index{movemesh23!orientation=}
\item [\texttt{orientation=}] set integer orientation of mesh.
\index{movemesh23!ptmerge=}
\item [\texttt{ptmerge =}] A real expression. When you transform a mesh, some points can be merged. This parameters is the criteria to define two merging points. By default, we use
$$
ptmerge \: = \: 1e-7 \: \:Vol( B ),
$$
where $B$ is the smallest axis parallel boxes containing the discretized domain of $\Omega$ and $Vol(B)$ is the volume of this box.
\end{description}

We can `do a `gluing'' of surface meshes using the process given in Section \ref{sec.changelab.gluemesh}. An example to obtain a three dimensional
mesh using the command line \texttt{tetg} and \texttt{movemesh23} is given in the file tetgencube.edp.

%% description des options de Tetgen dans ce cas.

\paragraph{The keyword ``tetgtransfo''} \index{tetgtransfo}

This keyword correspond to a composition of command line \texttt{tetg} and \texttt{movemesh23}:
\bFF
@tetgtransfo( Th2, transfo= [$\Phi$1, $\Phi$2, $\Phi$3] ), $\cdots$ ) = @tetg( Th3surf, $\cdots$ ),

where Th3surf = \texttt{movemesh23}( Th2,tranfo=[$\Phi$1, $\Phi$2, $\Phi$3] ) and Th2 is the input two dimensional mesh of \texttt{tetgtransfo}.

\index{tetgtransfo!regionlist=}
\index{tetgtransfo!nboffacetcl=}
\index{tetgtransfo!facetcl=}

The parameters of this command line are on the one hand the parameters: \\
\hspace*{2cm} \texttt{label}, \texttt{switch}, \texttt{regionlist} \texttt{nboffacetcl} \texttt{facetcl}\\
of keyword \texttt{tetg} and on the other hand the parameter \texttt{ptmerge} of keyword \texttt{movemesh23}.

\paragraph{Remark:} To use \texttt{tetgtransfo}, the result's mesh of \texttt{movemesh23} must be an closed surface and define one region only.
Therefore, the parameter \texttt{regionlist} is defined for one region.

An example of this keyword can be found in line  of file ``buildlayers.edp''

\paragraph{The keyword "tetgconvexhull"}\index{tetgconvexhull}

\freefempp, using tetgen, is able to build a tetrahedralization from a set of points. This
tetrahedralization is a Delaunay mesh of the convex hull of the set of points.

The coordinates of the points can be initialized in two ways. The first is a file that contains
the coordinate of points $X_{i}=(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$. This files is organized as follows:
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
n_{v} & & \\
x_{1} & y_{1} & z_{1}  \\
x_{2} & y_{2} & z_{2} \\
\vdots &\vdots & \vdots \\
x_{n_v} & y_{n_v} & z_{n_v}
\end{array}
$$
The second way is to give three arrays that correspond respectively to the
$x-$coordinates, $y-$coordinates and $z-$coordinates.\\

The parameters of this command line are
\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{switch  =}] A string expression. This string corresponds to the command line {\it{switch}} of TetGen see Section 3.2 of \cite{tetgen}.
\item [\texttt{reftet  =}] An integer expression. set the label of tetrahedra.
\item [\texttt{label =}] An integer expression. set the label of triangles.
\end{description}

In the string switch, we can't used the option 'p' and 'q' of tetgen.
%% Construire un example
\subsubsection{Reconstruct/Refine a three dimensional mesh with TetGen}
Meshes in three dimension can be refined using TetGen with the command line \texttt{tetgreconstruction}.

The parameter of this keyword are
\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{region=}] an integer array that allow to change the region number  of tetrahedra.
This array is defined as the parameter \texttt{reftet} in the keyword \texttt{change}.
\item [\texttt{label=}] an integer array that allow to change the label of boundary triangles.
This array is defined as the parameter \texttt{label} in the keyword \texttt{change}.
\item [\texttt{sizevolume=}] a reel function. This function allows to constraint volume size of tetrahedra in the domain. (see example \ref{ex:tetg-adap} to build 3d adapt mesh
\index{adaptation})
\end{description}

The parameter \texttt{switch} \texttt{nbofregions}, \texttt{regionlist},
\texttt{nboffacetcl} and \texttt{facetcl} of the command line which call TetGen (tetg)
is used for \texttt{tetgrefine}.

In the parameter \texttt{switch=}, the character 'r' should be used without the character 'p'.
For instance, see the manual of TetGen \cite{tetgen} for effect of 'r' to other character.

The parameter \texttt{regionlist} allows to define a new volume constraint in the region.
The label in the \texttt{regionlist} will be the previous label of region.
This parameter and \texttt{nbofregions} can't be used with parameter \texttt{sizevolume}.

\subsubsection{Moving mesh in three dimensions }

Meshes in three dimensions can be translated rotated and deformed using the command line movemesh as in the 2D case
(see section movemesh in chapiter 5). If $\Omega$ is tetrahedrized as $T_{h}(\Omega)$, and $\Phi(x,y)=(\Phi1(x,y,z), \Phi1(x,y,z), \Phi3(x,y,z))$
is a displacement vector then $\Phi(T_{h})$ is obtained by

\bFF
@mesh3 Th = @movemesh( Th, transfo=[$\Phi$1, $\Phi$2, $\Phi$3], ... );
\eFF

The parameters of movemesh in three dimensions are
\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{transfo =}] \texttt{[$\Phi$1,$\Phi$2, $\Phi$3]} set the displacement vector of 3D transformation $[\Phi1(x,y,z), \Phi2(x,y,z), \Phi3(x,y,z) ]$.
\item [\texttt{region  =}] set integer label of tetrahedra. 0 by default.
\item [\texttt{label =}] set the label of faces of border. This parameters is initialized as label for the keyword change (\ref{eq.org.vector.change.label}).
\item [\texttt{facemerge =}] An integer expression. When you transform a mesh, some faces can be merged. This parameters equals to one if merge's faces is considered.
Otherwise equals to zero. By default, this parameter is equals to 1.
\item [\texttt{ptmerge =}] A real expression. When you transform a mesh, some points can be merged. This parameters is the criteria to define two merging points.
By default, we use
$$
ptmerge \: = \: 1e-7 \: \:Vol( B ),
$$
where $B$ is the smallest axis parallel boxes containing the discretion domain of $\Omega$ and $Vol(B)$ is the volume of this box.
\end{description}


%%\paragraph{Remark:} This command line can be used also to move a surface mesh into an other surface mesh.

An example of this command can be found in the file ''Poisson3d.edp'' located in the directory examples++-3d.


\subsubsection{Layer mesh}

In this section, we present the command line to obtain a Layer mesh: \texttt{buildlayermesh}.
This mesh is obtained by extending a two dimensional mesh in the z-axis.

The domain $\Omega_{3d}$ defined by the layer mesh is equal to $\Omega_{3d} = \Omega_{2d} \times [zmin, zmax]$
where $\Omega_{2d}$ is the domain define by the two dimensional mesh, $zmin$ and $zmax$ are function
of $\Omega_{2d}$ in $R$ that defines respectively the lower surface and upper surface of $\Omega_{3d}$.

\begin{figure}
\hspace*{4cm} \includegraphics[height=5cm]{buillayermesh}
\caption{Example of Layer mesh in three dimension.}
\label{fig-layermeshextend}
\end{figure}

For a vertex of a two dimensional mesh $V_{i}^{2d} = (x_{i},y_{i})$, we introduce the number of associated vertices in the $z-$axis $M_{i}+1$.
We denote by $M$ the maximum of $M_{i}$ over the vertices of the two dimensional mesh. This value are called the number of layers
(if $\forall i, \; M_{i}=M$ then there are $M$ layers in the mesh of $\Omega_{3d}$). $V_{i}^{2d}$ generated $M+1$ vertices which are defined by
$$
\forall j=0, \ldots, M, \qquad  V_{i,j}^{3d} = ( x_{i}, y_{i}, \theta_{i}(z_{i,j})  ),
$$
where $(z_{i,j})_{j=0,\ldots,M}$ are the $M+1$ equidistant points on the interval $[zmin( V_{i}^{2d} ), zmax( V_{i}^{2d})]$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
z_{i,j} =  j \: \delta \alpha + zmin(V_{i}^{2d}), \qquad \delta \alpha= \frac{ zmax( V_{i}^{2d} ) - zmin( V_{i}^{2d}) }{M}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The function $\theta_{i}$, defined on  $[zmin( V_{i}^{2d} ), zmax( V_{i}^{2d} )]$, is given by
$$
\theta_{i}(z) = \left \{
\begin{array}{cl}
\theta_{i,0} & \mbox{if} \: z=zmin(V_{i}^{2d}), \\
\theta_{i,j} & \mbox{if} \: z \in ] \theta_{i,j-1}, \theta_{i,j}],\\
\end{array}
\right.
$$
with $(\theta_{i,j})_{j=0,\ldots,M_{i}}$ are the $M_{i}+1$ equidistant points on the interval $[zmin( V_{i}^{2d} ), zmax( V_{i}^{2d} )]$.\\

Set a triangle $K=(V_{i1}^{2d}$, $V_{i2}^{2d}$, $V_{i3}^{2d})$ of the two dimensional mesh.
$K$ is associated with a triangle on the upper surface (resp. on the lower surface) of layer mesh:
$( V_{i1,M}^{3d}, V_{i2,M}^{3d}, V_{i3,M}^{3d} )$ (resp. $( V_{i1,0}^{3d}, V_{i2,0}^{3d}, V_{i3,0}^{3d})$).

Also $K$ is associated with $M$ volume prismatic elements which are defined by
$$
\forall j=0,\ldots,M, \quad H_{j} = ( V_{i1,j}^{3d}, V_{i2,j}^{3d}, V_{i3,j}^{3d}, V_{i1,j+1}^{3d}, V_{i2,j+1}^{3d}, V_{i3,j+1}^{3d} ).
$$

Theses volume elements can have some merged point:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0 merged point : prism
\item 1 merged points : pyramid
\item 2 merged points : tetrahedra
\item 3 merged points : no elements
\end{itemize}

The elements with merged points are called degenerate elements. To obtain a mesh with tetrahedra, we decompose
the pyramid into two tetrahedra and the prism into three tetrahedra. These tetrahedra are obtained by cutting the quadrilateral
face of pyramid and prism with the diagonal which have the vertex with the maximum index (see \cite{hdrHecht} for the reaspn of this choice).\\

The triangles on the middle surface obtained with the decomposition of the volume prismatic elements are the triangles generated by the edges
on the border of the two dimensional mesh. The label of triangles on the border elements and tetrahedra are defined with the label of these
associated elements.\\


The arguments of \texttt{buildlayermesh} is a two dimensional mesh and the number of layers $M$.

The parameters of this command are:
\begin{description}

at index $2i$ and the corresponding  3d label number at index $2i+1$, like (\ref{eq.org.vector.change.label}).

\item [\texttt{labeldown =}] Same as the previous case but for the lower/down face label .
\end{description}

Moreover, we also add post processing parameters that allow to moving the mesh. These parameters correspond to parameters
\texttt{transfo}, \texttt{facemerge} and \texttt{ptmerge} of the command line \texttt{movemesh}.

The vector \texttt{region}, \texttt{labelmid}, \texttt{labelup} and \texttt{labeldown} These vectors are composed of $n_{l}$ successive pairs of number $O_i,N_l$  where $n_{l}$ is the number (label or region)
that we want to get.

\subsection{The output solution formats .sol and .solb}
With the keyword savesol, we can store a scalar functions, a scalar FE functions,
a vector fields, a vector FE fields, a symmetric tensor and a symmetric FE tensor..
Such format is used in medit.

\paragraph{extension file .sol}
\def\Int#1{ {\tt(I)} #1}
\def\Loop#1#2{{\bf\Large(}\,#1\,{\bf\Large{,\,\,}}\,#2\,{\bf\Large)}}

The first two lines of the file are
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt MeshVersionFormatted 0}
\end{itemize}
\normalsize

\small
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt Dimension}
  \Int{dim}
\end{itemize}

The following fields begin with one of the following keyword:
SolAtVertices, SolAtEdges, SolAtTriangles, SolAtQuadrilaterals,
SolAtTetrahedra, SolAtPentahedra, SolAtHexahedra.

In each field, we give then in the next line the number of elements in the solutions
(SolAtVertices: number of vertices, SolAtTriangles: number of triangles, ...). In other lines, we give
 the number of solutions , the type of solution (1: scalar, 2: vector, 3: symmetric tensor).
 And finally,  we give the values of the solutions on the elements.

The file must be ended with the keyword End.

The real element of symmetric tensor
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{savesol.def.symtensor}
ST^{3d}=\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
ST_{xx}^{3d} & ST_{xy}^{3d} & ST_{xz}^{3d}\\
ST_{yx}^{3d} & ST_{yy}^{3d} & ST_{yz}^{3d} \\
ST_{zx}^{3d} & ST_{zy}^{3d} & ST_{zz}^{3d}
\end{array}
\right)
\qquad \qquad
ST^{2d}= \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
ST_{xx}^{2d} & ST_{xy}^{2d} \\
ST_{yx}^{2d} & ST_{yy}^{2d}
\end{array}
\right)
\end{eqnarray}
stored in the extension .sol are respectively $ST_{xx}^{3d}, ST_{yx}^{3d}, ST_{yy}^{3d}, ST_{zx}^{3d}, ST_{zy}^{3d}, ST_{zz}^{3d}$
and  $ST_{xx}^{2d}, ST_{yx}^{2d}, ST_{yy}^{2d}$

An example of field with the keyword SolAtTetrahedra:
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt{SolAtTetrahedra}}\\
  \Int{NbOfTetrahedrons}
  {\tt \obeylines
  $ \mathtt{ \quad nbsol \quad typesol^1 \quad ... \quad typesol^n }  $
  $\left(\left(\left( \mathtt{U}_{ij}^k, \quad \forall i \in \{1,...,\mathtt{nbrealsol}^k\}\right), %
\quad \forall k \in \{1,...\mathtt{nbsol}\}\right) %
 \quad \forall j \in \{1,...,\mathtt{NbOfTetrahedrons}\}\right)$
 }
\end{itemize}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt  nbsol} is an integer equal to the number of solutions
\item $\mathtt{  typesol^k}$, type of the solution  number $ k$, is
  \begin{itemize}
   \item $\mathtt{typesol^k = 1}$ the solution {\tt k} is scalar.
   \item $\mathtt{typesol^k = 2}$ the solution {\tt k} is vectorial.
   \item $\mathtt{typesol^k = 3}$ the solution {\tt k} is a symmetric tensor or symmetric matrix.
   \end{itemize}
\item  $\mathtt{  nbrealsol^k}$ number of real to discribe solution number $k$ is
  \begin{itemize}
   \item $\mathtt{nbrealsol^k = 1}$ the solution {\tt k} is scalar.
   \item $\mathtt{nbrealsol^k = dim}$ the solution {\tt k} is vectorial ($dim$ is the dimension of the solution).
   \item $\mathtt{nbrealsol^k = dim*(dim+1)/2}$ the solution {\tt k} is a symmetric tensor or symmetric matrix.
   \end{itemize}
\item  {\tt U$_{ij}^k$} is a real equal to the value of the component  $i$ of the solution  $k$ at tetrahedra $j$
on the associated mesh.
\end{itemize}

This field is written with the notation of Section \ref{meshformatfile.mesh}.
The format .solb is the same as format .sol but in binary (read/write is faster, storage is less).

A real scalar functions $f1$, a vector fields $\Phi=[\Phi1,\Phi2,\Phi3]$ and a symmetric tensor $ST^{3d}$
(\ref{savesol.def.symtensor}) at the vertices of the three dimensional mesh Th3 is stored in the file "f1PhiTh3.sol" using
\index{savesol!order=}
\bFF
@savesol("f1PhiST3dTh3.sol",Th3, $f1$, [$\Phi$1, $\Phi$2, $\Phi$3], VV3, order=1);
\eFF
where $VV3=[ ST_{xx}^{3d}, ST_{yx}^{3d}, ST_{yy}^{3d}, ST_{zx}^{3d}, ST_{zy}^{3d}, ST_{zz}^{3d}]$.
For a two dimensional mesh Th, A real scalar functions $f2$, a vector fields $\Psi=[\Psi1,\Psi2]$ and a symmetric tensor $ST^{2d}$
(\ref{savesol.def.symtensor}) at triangles is stored in the file "f2PsiST2dTh3.solb" using
\bFF

%%set the $nbst$ symmetric tensor solutions.

In the file, solutions are stored in this order : scalar solutions, vector solutions and finally symmetric
tensor solutions.

\subsection{medit}

The keyword medit allows to dipslay a mesh alone or a mesh and one or several functions defined on the mesh using the Pascal Frey's freeware medit.
Medit opens its own window and uses OpenGL extensively.
Naturally to use this command  medit must be installed.
%%This command allow to represent one solution.

A vizualisation with medit of scalar solutions $f1$ and $f2$ continuous, piecewise linear and known at the vertices of the mesh Th is obtained using
\bFF
@medit("sol1 sol2",Th, $f1$, $f2$, order=1);
\eFF
The first plot  named ``sol1'' display f1. The second plot names ``sol2'' display f2.

The arguments of function \texttt{medit} are the name of the differents scenes (separated by a space) of medit, a mesh and solutions.
Each solution is associated with one scene. The scalar, vector and symmetric tensor solutions are specified in the format described in the section dealing with the keyword \texttt{savesol}.

%%These arguments must be given in this order.

The parameters of this command line are
\begin{description}
%%\item [\texttt{solution =}] An integer parameter. This parameter is equal to 0 if there is no solution to display and otherwise is equal to 1.
\item [\texttt{order =}] 0 is the solution is given at the center of gravity of elements.
1 is the solution is given at the vertices of elements.
\index{medit!order=}
\index{medit!meditff=}
\item [\texttt{meditff =}] set the name of execute command of medit. By default, this string is medit.
\index{medit!save=}
\item [\texttt{save =}] set the name of a file .sol or .solb to save solutions.
%%\item [\texttt{scalar =}] set the scalar solutions to display.
%%two dimensional case:
%%\item [\texttt{vector =}] set the vector field solution $v=(v_{x},v_{y})$. This parameter is equal to \texttt{[$v_{x}$,$v_{y}$]}.
%%\item [\texttt{symtensor =}]  set the symmetric tensor solution
%%$
%%f= \left (
%%\begin{array}{cc}
%%f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\
%%f_{yx} & f_{yy}
%%\end{array}
%%\right)
%%$. This parmameter is equal to \texttt{[$f_{xx}$, $f_{yx}$, $f_{yy}$]}
%%three dimensional case:
%%\item [\texttt{vector =}] set the vector field solution $v=(v_{x},v_{y},v_{z})$. This parameter is equal to  \texttt{[$v_{x}$,$v_{y}$,$v_{z}$]}.
%%\item [\texttt{symtensor =}] set the symmetric tensor solution
%%$
%%f= \left (
%%\begin{array}{ccc}
%%f_{xx} & f_{xy} & f_{xz}\\
%%f_{yx} & f_{yy} & f_{yz} \\
%%f_{zx} & f_{zy} & f_{zz}
%%\end{array}
%%\right)
%%$. This parameter is equal to \texttt{[$f_{xx}$, $f_{yx}$, $f_{yy}$, $f_{zx}$, $f_{zy}$, $f_{zz}$]}
\end{description}

This command line allows also to represent two differents meshes and solutions on them in the same windows.
The nature of solutions must be the same. Hence, we can vizualize in the same window the different
domains in a domain decomposition method for instance. A vizualisation with medit of scalar solutions $h1$ and $h2$
at vertices of the mesh Th1 and Th2 respectively  are obtained using
\bFF
@medit("sol2domain",Th1, $h1$, Th2, $h2$, order=1);

\subsection{Mshmet}
\label{sec:mshmet}

Mshmet is a software developped by P. Frey that allows to compute an anisotropic metric based on solutions (i.e. Hessian-based). This sofware can return also an isotropic metric. Moreover,  mshmet can construct also a metric suitable for level sets interface capturing. The solution can be defined on 2D or 3D structured/unstructured meshes. For example, the solution can be an error estimate of a FE solutions.

%%Error estimate for 2d and 3d unstructured meshes.
%%Compute anisotropic metric based on solution variations (i.e. Hessian-based).
%%One option allows to construct a metric suitable for level set interface capturing.

Solutions for mshmet are given as an argument. The solution can be a func, a vector func, a symmetric tensor, a FE func, a FE vector func and a FE symmetric tensor. The symmetric tensor argument is defined as this type of data for datasol argument. This software accepts more than one solution.

For example, the metric $M$ computed with mshmet  for the solution $u$ defined on the mesh $Th$ is obtained by writing.
\bFF
fespace Vh(Th,P1);
Vh u; // a scalar FE func
real[int] M = mshmet(Th,u);
\eFF

The parameters of the keyword mshmet are :
\begin{itemize}\parskip=0cm

\item loptions(5): number of regularization's iteration of solutions given (default 0). 
\item loptions(6): previously metric parameter (default 0). 1 for using previous metric otherwise 0.
\end{itemize}

\item \texttt{doptions}= a vector of double of size 4. This vector contains the real parameters of mshmet (for expert only).
\begin{itemize}
\item doptions(0):  hmin : min size parameters  (default 0.01).

\item doptions(2):  eps : tolerance parameters ( default 0.01).
\item doptions(2):  width : relative width for Level Set ($0<w<1$) ( default 0.05).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The result of the keyword \texttt{mshmet} is a \texttt{real[int]} which contains the metric computed by  \texttt{mshmet}  at the different vertices $V_{i}$ of the mesh.

With $nv$ is the number of vertices, the structure of this vector is

\end{array}
\right)$, the parameters \texttt{metric}  is $$M_{aniso}= ( H(V_{0}), \ldots, H(V_{nv}) )^t $$

\subsection{FreeYams}
\label{sec:freeyams}
FreeYams is a surface mesh adaptation software which is developed by P. Frey. This software is a new version of yams. The adapted surface mesh is constructed with a geometric metric tensor field. This  field is based on the intrinsic properties of the discrete surface. Also this software allows to construct a simplification of a mesh. This decimation is  based on the Hausdorff distance between the initial and the current triangulation. Compared to the software yams, FreeYams  can be used also to produce anisotropic triangulations adapted to level set simulations. A technical report on FreeYams is not available yet but a documentation on yams exists at  http://www.ann.jussieu.fr/$\sim$frey/software.html \cite{tech.freeyams}.

To call FreeYams in Freefem++, we used the keyword freeyams. The arguments of this function are the initial mesh and/or metric. The metric with freeyams are a function, a FE function, a symmetric tensor function, a symmetric tensor FE function or a vector of double. If the metric is vector of double, this data must be given in \texttt{metric} parameter. Otherwise, the metric is given in the argument.

For example, the  adapted mesh of $Thinit$ defined by the metric $u$ defined as FE function is obtained in writing.
\bFF
@fespace Vh(Thinit,P1);
Vh u;
@mesh3 Th=@freeyams(Thinit,u);
\eFF
The symmetric tensor argument for freeyams keyword is defined as this type of data for datasol argument.

\subsection{mmg3d}
\label{sec:mmg3d}
Mmg3d is a 3D remeshing software developed by C. Dobrzynski and P. Frey 

(http://www.math.u-bordeaux1.fr/$\sim$dobj/logiciels/mmg3d.php). To obtain a version of this library send an e-mail at : 

cecile.dobrzynski@math.ubordeaux1.fr or pascal.frey@upmc.fr.

This software allows to remesh an initial mesh made of tetrahedra. This initial mesh is adapted to a geometric metric tensor field or to a displacement vector (moving rigid body). The metric can be obtained with mshmet (see section \ref{sec:mshmet}).\\

\begin{remark} : 
\begin{description}
\item[(a)] If no metric is given, an isotropic metric is computed by analyzing the size of the edges in the initial mesh.
\item[(b)] if a displacement is given, the vertices of the surface triangles are moved without verifying the geometrical structure of the new surface mesh.
\end{description}
\end{remark}
The parameters of  mmg3d are :
\begin{itemize}\parskip=0cm
%\item [\texttt{nvmax}=] integer expresion. It's correspond to the number of maximum vertices in the solution mesh.
%\item [\texttt{ntrimax}=] integer expresion. It's correspond to the number of maximum triangles in the solution mesh.
%\item [\texttt{ntetmax}=] integer expresion. It's correspond to the number of maximum triangles in the solution mesh.

$\Phi(x,y) = [\Phi1(x,y), \Phi2(x,y), \Phi3(x,y) ]$.
\item \texttt{displVect=} sets the vector displacement in a vector expression. This vector contains the displacement at each point of the initial mesh. It is a vector of size 3 $nv$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Build a 2d mesh from a isoline}
\index{isoline}

 The idea is get the discretization of a isoline to fluid meshes, this tool  can be useful to
 construct meshes from image. First, we give an example of the isovalue meshes $0.2$  of analytical function $ \sqrt{(x-1/2)^2 +(y-1/2)^2}$,
 on unit square. 
\begin{example}[isoline.edp]
\label{ex:isoline.edp}~\hfill\break
\bFF
load "isoline" // load the plugin "isoline"

@real[@int,@int] xy(3,1); // to store the isoline points 
@int[@int] be(1);// to store the begin , end couple of lines
{// a block for memory management 
  @mesh Th=square(10,10);//,[x*.5,y*0.5]);
  @fespace Vh(Th,P1);
  Vh u= @sqrt(square(x-0.5)+square(y-0.5));
  @real iso= 0.2 ;
  @real[int] viso=[iso];
  @plot(u,viso=viso,Th);// to see the iso line 

  @int nbc= isoline(Th,u,xy,close=1,iso=iso,beginend=be,smoothing=0.1);
\eFF

The isoline parameters are \texttt{Th} the mesh, the expression $u$ , the  bidimentionnal array \texttt{xy}
to store the list coordinate of the points. The list of named parameter are:
\begin{description}
\item[iso=]  value of the isoline  to compute ($\bm{0}$ is the default value)
\item[close=] close the iso line with the border (def. true), we add the part of the mesh border such the value
 is less than the iso value 
\item[smoothing=] nb of smoothing process  is  the ${l} ^{r} {s} $ where
$l$ is the length of the current  line component, $r$ the ratio, $s$ is smoothing  value. The smoothing default value is $\bm{0}$.
\item[ratio=] the ratio ( $1$ by default). 
\item[eps=] relative $\varepsilon$  (see code ??)  (def 1e-10 )
\item[beginend=]  array to get begin, end couple of each of sub line  (resize automatically)
\item[file=] to save the data  curve in data file for gnu plot
\end{description}

In the array \texttt{xy} you get the list of vertices of the isoline,
each connex line go from $i= i_0^c ,\dots, i_1^c-1$ with $i_0^c =be(2*c)$  $i_1^c =be(2*c+1)$, and
  where $x_i= xy(0,i), y_i=yx( 1,i), l_i=xy(2,i) $. 
Here  $l_i$ is the length of the line (the origin of the line is point  $i_0^c$).

The  sense  of the  isoline is such that the upper part is at the left  size of the  isoline.
So here : the minimum is a point $0.5,05$ so  the curve 1 turn in the clockwise  sense, 
the order of each component are sort such the the number of point by component is decreasing .

\bFF   
  @cout << " nb of the line  component   = " << nbc << endl; 
  @cout << " n = " << xy.m << endl; // number  of points 
  @cout << "be = " << be << endl; //  begin end of the each componant

  // show the lines component 
  @for( @int c=0;c<nbc; ++c) 
  {
    @int i0 = be[2*c], i1 = be[2*c+1]-1;//begin,end of the line component
    @cout << " Curve " << c << endl; 
    @for(int i=i0; i<= i1; ++i)
       @cout << " x= " << xy(0,i) <<" y= " << xy(1,i) << " s= " 
             << xy(2,i) << endl; 
    plot([xy(0,i0:i1),xy(1,i0:i1)],wait=1,viso=viso,cmm = " curve "+c);
  }
}// end of block for  memory management 

@cout << " len of  last  curve = " << xy(2,xy.m-1) << endl;; 
\eFF

We also have a  new function to parametrize easly  a
discret \texttt{Curve} defined by couple $be, xy$. \index{Curve}

\bFF
@border Curve0(t=0,1) // the extern boundary 
{ @int c =0; // component 0
  @int i0 = be[2*c], i1 = be[2*c+1]-1;   
  P=@Curve(xy,i0,i1,t); // Curve 0
  label=1; 
} 

@border Curve1(t=0,1) 
{ @int c =1; // component 1
  @int i0 = be[2*c], i1 = be[2*c+1]-1;   
  P=Curve(xy,i0,i1,t);  // Curve 1
  label=1; 
} 

@plot(Curve1(100)); // show curve. 
@mesh Th= buildmesh(Curve1(-100));// because 
@plot(Th,wait=1);// 
\eFF
\end{example}

Secondly, we use this idea to build meshes from image, we use the plugins
\texttt{ppm2rnm} to read \texttt{pgm} gray scale image, and we extract the 
gray contour at level $0.25$.  

\begin{example}[Leman-mesh.edp]
\label{ex:Leman-mesh.edp}~\hfill\break
\bFF
@load "ppm2rnm" @load "isoline"
@string leman="lg.pgm"; //see figure \ref{fig:lg}
@real AreaLac =  580.03; // in $Km^2$
@real hsize= 5; // mesh sir in pixel ..
@real[int,int] Curves(3,1);
@int[int] be(1);
@int nc;// nb of curve 
{  
  @real[int,int] ff1(leman); // read  image (figure \ref{fig:lg}) 
  // and set to an rect.  array \index{ppm2rnm}
  @int nx = ff1.n, ny=ff1.m; // grey value between 0 to 1 (dark)
  // build a Cartesian mesh such that the origin is qt the right place.
  @mesh Th=square(nx-1,ny-1,[(nx-1)*(x),(ny-1)*(1-y)]);   
   // warning  the numbering is of the vertices (x,y) is 
   // given by $  i = x/nx + nx* y/ny $
  @fespace Vh(Th,P1);
   Vh f1; f1[]=ff1; //  transforme array in finite element function.
  nc=@isoline(Th,f1,iso=0.25,close=1,Curves,beginend=be,smoothing=.1,ratio=0.5); 
}
// the longest isoline : the lac .. 
@int ic0=be(0), ic1=be(1)-1;		
plot([Curves(0,ic0:ic1),Curves(1,ic0:ic1)], wait=1);
@int NC= Curves(2,ic1)/hsize;
@border G(t=0,1) {  @P=@Curve(Curves,ic0,ic1,t);  @label= 1 + (x>xl)*2 + (y<yl);} 	

plot(G(-NC),wait=1); 
@mesh Th=buildmesh(G(-NC));
plot(Th,wait=1);
@real scale = sqrt(AreaLac/Th.area);
Th=@movemesh(Th,[x*scale,y*scale]);//resize the mesh  
@cout << " Th.area = " << Th.area << " Km^2 " << " == " << AreaLac <<  "   Km^2 " << endl ;

As stated in Section \ref{sec:example}.
FEM approximates all functions $w$ as
\[
w(x,y)\simeq w_0\phi_0(x,y)+w_1\phi_1(x,y)+\cdots+w_{M-1}\phi_{M-1}(x,y)
\]
with finite element basis functions $\phi_k(x,y)$ and numbers $w_k$ ($k=0,\cdots,M-1$).
The functions $\phi_k(x,y)$ are constructed from the triangle $T_{i_k}$, and called  \emph{shape functions}.
In \freefempp the finite element space
$$
V_h=\left\{w\left|\; w_0\phi_0+w_1\phi_1+\cdots+w_{M-1}\phi_{M-1},\,
w_i\in \R\right.\right\}

\ttCC{IDspace} is the name of the space (e.g. \ttCC{Vh}),

\ttCC{IDmesh} is the name of the associated mesh and  \ttCC{<IDFE>}

In 2D we have a pair of periodic boundary condition, \label{periodic BC}

\texttt{int}, and the 2 labels \ttCC{la$_i$} and \ttCC{lb$_i$}
refer to 2 pieces of boundary to be in equivalence.

If \ttCC{[la$_i$,sa$_i$],[lb$_i$,sb$_i$]} is a pair of \texttt{real},
then \ttCC{sa$_i$} and \ttCC{sb$_i$}
give two common abscissa on the two boundary curve, and two points are identified as one
if the two abscissa are equal.

In 2D, we have a pair of periodic boundary condition,% \label{periodic BC}

define the 2 piece of boundary to be in equivalence.

then \ttCC{sa$_i$,ta$_i$} and \ttCC{sb$_i$,tb$_i$}
give two common parameters on the two boundary surface, and two points are identified as one
if the two parameters are equal.


\begin{remark} The 2D  mesh of the two identified borders must be the same, so
to be sure,  use  the parameter  \texttt{fixeborder=true} in \texttt{buildmesh} command (see \ref{buildmesh fixeborder})
like in example \texttt{periodic2bis.edp} (see \ref{exm:periodic4bis}).

\subsection{Lagrangian Finite Elements}
\label{sec:P0P1P2}
\subsubsection{P0-element}
For each triangle (d=2)  or tetrahedron (d=3)  $T_k$, the basis function $\phi_k$ in \texttt{Vh(Th,P0)}
is given by
$$
\phi_k(\bm{x})=1\textrm{ if }(\bm{x})\in T_k,\qquad
\phi_k(\bm{x})=0\textrm{ if }(\bm{x})\not\in T_k
$$
If we write
\bFF
Vh(Th,@P0);  Vh fh=$f(x,y)$;
\eFF
then for vertices $q^{k_i},\, i=1,2,.. d+1 $ in Fig. \ref{P1P2}(a), $f_h$ is built as
$$
\ttCC{fh}=f_h(x,y)=\sum_k f(\frac{\sum_i q^{k_i}}{d+1}) \phi_k
$$
See Fig. \ref{projP0} for the projection of $f(x,y)=\sin(\pi x)\cos(\pi y)$
on \ttCC{Vh(Th,@P0)} when
the mesh \ttCC{Th} is a $4\times 4$-grid of $[-1,1]^2$ as in Fig. \ref{P0P1P2P1nc}.

\subsubsection{P1-element}
\plot[height=4cm]{P1P2}{$P_1$  and $P_2$ degrees of freedom on triangle $T_k$}

For each vertex $q^i$, the basis function $\phi_i$ in \texttt{Vh(Th,P1)}
is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\phi_i(x,y)=a^k_i+b^k_ix+c^k_iy~\textrm{for }(x,y)\in T_k,\\
&&\phi_i(q^i)=1,\quad \phi_i(q^j)=0\textrm{ if }i\neq j
\end{eqnarray*}
The basis function $\phi_{k_1}(x,y)$ with the vertex $q^{k_1}$ in
Fig. \ref{P1P2}(a) at point $p=(x,y)$ in triangle $T_k$ simply coincide with the
\emph{barycentric coordinates $\lambda^k_1$ (area coordinates)} :
$$
\phi_{k_1}(x,y) = \lambda^k_{1}(x,y)=
\frac{\textrm{area of triangle} (p, q^{k_2},q^{k_3})}
{\textrm{area of triangle}(q^{k_1},q^{k_2},q^{k_3})}
$$
If we write
\bFF
Vh(Th,@P1); Vh fh=$g(x.y)$;
\eFF
then
$$
\ttCC{fh}=f_h(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^{n_v}f(q^i)\phi_i(x,y)
$$
See Fig. \ref{projP1} for the projection of $f(x,y)=\sin(\pi x)\cos(\pi y)$
into \ttCC{Vh(Th,@P1)}.

\subsubsection{P2-element}
For each vertex or midpoint $q^i$. the basis function $\phi_i$ in \texttt{Vh(Th,P2)}
is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\phi_i(x,y)=a^k_i+b^k_ix+c^k_iy+d^k_ix^2+e^k_ixy+f^f_jy^2~\textrm{for }(x,y)\in T_k,\\
&&\phi_i(q^i)=1,\quad \phi_i(q^j)=0\textrm{ if }i\neq j
\end{eqnarray*}
The basis function $\phi_{k_1}(x,y)$ with the vertex $q^{k_1}$ in
Fig. \ref{P1P2}(b) is defined by the \emph{barycentric coordinates}:
$$
\phi_{k_1}(x,y) = \lambda^k_{1}(x,y)(2\lambda^k_1(x,y)-1)
$$
and for the midpoint $q^{k_2}$
$$
\phi_{k_2}(x,y) = 4\lambda^k_1(x,y)\lambda^k_4(x,y)
$$
If we write
\bFF
Vh(Th,@P2); Vh fh=$f(x.y)$;
\eFF
then
$$
\ttCC{fh}=f_h(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}f(q^i)\phi_i(x,y)\quad (\textrm{summation over all vetex or midpoint})
$$

\subsection{P1 Nonconforming Element}
Refer to \cite{Thomasset} for details; briefly, we now consider non-continuous approximations
so we shall lose the property
$$
w_h\in V_h\subset H^1(\Omega)
$$
If we write
\bFF
Vh(Th,@P1nc); Vh fh=$f(x.y)$;
\eFF
then
$$
\ttCC{fh}=f_h(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^{n_v}f(m^i)\phi_i(x,y)\quad (\textrm{summation over all midpoint})
$$
Here the basis function $\phi_i$ associated with the midpoint
$m^i=(q^{k_i}+q^{k_{i+1}})/2$ where $q^{k_i}$ is the $i$-th point in $T_k$,
and we assume that $j+1=0$ if $j=3$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\phi_i(x,y)=a^k_i+b^k_ix+c^k_iy~\textrm{for }(x,y)\in T_k,\\
&&\phi_i(m^i)=1,\quad \phi_i(m^j)=0\textrm{ if }i\neq j
\end{eqnarray*}

Strictly speaking $\p \phi_i/\p x,\, \p \phi_i/\p y$
contain Dirac distribution $\rho \delta_{\p T_k}$.
The numerical calculations will automatically \emph{ignore} them.
In \cite{Thomasset}, there is a proof of the estimation
\[
\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n_v}\int_{T_k}|\nabla w-\nabla w_h|^2\d x\d y\right)^{1/2}
=O(h)
\]
The basis functions $\phi_k$ have the following properties.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  For the bilinear form $a$ defined in (\ref{eqn:bilinear}) satisfy
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  &&a(\phi_i,\phi_i)>0,\qquad a(\phi_i,\phi_j)\le 0\quad\textrm{if }i\neq j\\
  &&\sum_{k=1}^{n_v}a(\phi_i,\phi_k)\ge 0
  \end{eqnarray*}
  \item
  $f\ge 0 \Rightarrow u_h\ge 0$
  \item If $i\neq j$, the basis function $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$ are $L^2$-orthogonal:
  $$
  \int_{\Omega}\phi_i\phi_j\, \d x\d y=0\qquad \textrm{if }i\neq j
  $$
  which is false for $P_1$-element.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Other FE-space}
For each triangle $T_k\in \mathcal{T}_h$,
let $\lambda_{k_1}(x,y),\, \lambda_{k_2}(x,y),\, \lambda_{k_3}(x,y)$ be
the area cordinate
of the triangle (see Fig. \ref{P1P2}), and put
\begin{equation}
\beta_k(x,y)=27\lambda_{k_1}(x,y)\lambda_{k_2}(x,y)\lambda_{k_3}(x,y)
\end{equation}
called \emph{bubble}\index{bubble} function on $T_k$.
The bubble function has the feature:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  $\beta_k(x,y)=0\quad \textrm{if }(x,y)\in \p T_k$.
  \item
  $\beta_k(q^{k_b})=1$ where $q^{k_b}$ is the barycenter
  $\frac{q^{k_1}+q^{k_2}+q^{k_3}}{3}$.
\end{enumerate}
If we write
\bFF
Vh(Th,@P1b); Vh fh=$f(x.y)$;
\eFF
then
$$
\texttt{fh}=f_h(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^{n_v}f(q^i)\phi_i(x,y)+\sum_{k=1}^{n_t}f(q^{k_b})\beta_k(x,y)
$$

Functions from  $\R^{2}$ to $\R^{N}$ with $N=1$ is called scalar function and
called \emph{vector valued} when $N>1$.

\subsubsection{Raviart-Thomas element}
In the Raviart-Thomas finite element $RT0_{h}$,
the degree of freedom are the fluxes  across edges $e$ of the mesh, where the flux of the function $\mathbf{f} : \R^2 \longrightarrow \R^2 $ is $\int_{e} \mathbf{f}.n_{e}$,
 $n_{e}$ is the unit normal of edge $e$.

 This implies a orientation of all the edges of the mesh,
 for example we can use the global numbering of the edge vertices and we just go from small to large numbers.

To compute the flux, we use a quadrature  with one Gauss point, the middle point of the edge.
Consider a triangle $T_k$ with three vertices $(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})$.
Let denote the  vertices numbers by $i_{a},i_{b},i_{c}$, and define the three edge
vectors $\mathbf{e}^{1},\mathbf{e}^{2},\mathbf{e}^{3}$
by $ sgn(i_{b}-i_{c})(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{c})$, $sgn(i_{c}-i_{a})(\mathbf{c}-\mathbf{a})$,
$sgn(i_{a}-i_{b})(\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b})$,

We get three basis functions,
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\phi}^{k}_{1}= \frac{sgn(i_{b}-i_{c})}{2|T_k|}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{a}),\quad
\boldsymbol{\phi}^{k}_{2}= \frac{sgn(i_{c}-i_{a})}{2|T_k|}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}),\quad
\boldsymbol{\phi}^{k}_{3}= \frac{sgn(i_{a}-i_{b})}{2|T_k|}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{c}),
\end{equation}
where $|T_k|$ is the area of the triangle $T_k$.
If we write
\bFF
Vh(Th,@RT0); Vh [f1h,f2h]=[$f1(x.y),f2(x,y)$];
\eFF
then
$$
\ttCC{fh}=\vec{f}_h(x,y)=\sum_{k=1}^{n_t}\sum_{l=1}^6
n_{i_lj_l}|\mathbf{e^{i_l}}|f_{j_l}(m^{i_l})
\phi_{i_lj_l}
$$
where $n_{i_lj_l}$ is the $j_l$-th component of the normal vector
$\vec{n}_{i_l}$,
$$
\{m_1,m_2,m_3\} = \left\{\frac{\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}}{2},
\frac{\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{c}}{2},
\frac{\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{a}}{2} \right\}
$$
and
$i_l=\{1,1,2,2,3,3\},\, j_l=\{1,2,1,2,1,2\}$ with the order
of $l$.

\end{example}


 To get the value at a point $x=1,y=2$ of the FE function \texttt{uh},
 or \texttt{[Uxh,Uyh]},one writes

\bFF
   @real value;
   value = uh(2,4);       //  get value= uh(2,4)
   value = Uxh(2,4);      // get value= Uxh(2,4)
   //  ------  or ------
   x=1;y=2;
   value = uh;       // get value= uh(1,2)
   value = Uxh;      // get value= Uxh(1,2)
   value = Uyh;      // get value= Uyh(1,2).
\eFF

  To get the value of the array associated to the FE function
  \texttt{uh}, one writes

  \index{FE function!value}\index{FE function![]|textbf}
  \index{FE function!n|textbf}\index{[]@\verb=[]=}\index{n}

\bFF
   @real value = uh[][0] ; // get the value of degree of freedom 0
   @real maxdf = uh[].max; //  maximum value of degree of freedom
   @int size = uh.n; // the number of degree of freedom
   @real[int] array(uh.n)= uh[]; //  copy the array of the function uh
\eFF
\begin{note} For a none scalar finite element function   \texttt{[Uxh,Uyh]}
 the two array \texttt{Uxh[]} and  \texttt{Uyh[]} are the same array, because
 the degree of freedom can touch more than one component.

\subsection{A \setS{Fast Finite Element Interpolator}}
\medskip
In practice one may discretize the variational equations by the Finite Element method. Then
there will be one mesh for $\Omega_1$ and another one for $\Omega_2$.  The computation
of integrals of products of functions defined on different meshes is difficult.
Quadrature formulae and interpolations from one mesh to another at quadrature points are needed.
We present below the interpolation operator which we have used and which is new,
to the best of our knowledge.
\bigskip
Let ${\cal T}_{h}^0=\cup_k T^0_k,{\cal T}_{h}^1=\cup_k T^1_k$ be two triangulations of a domain $\Omega$.
Let
$$
V({\hbox{${\cal T}$}_{h}^i}) =\{ C^0(\Omega_h^i)~:~f|_{T^i_k}\in P_0\},~~~i=0,1
$$
be the spaces of continuous piecewise affine functions on each triangulation.

Let $f\in V({\cal T}_{h}^0)$. The problem is to find $g\in V({\cal T}_{h}^1)$ such that
$$
g(q) = f(q) \quad \forall q\hbox{~vertex of ~} {\cal T}_{h}^1
$$
Although this is a seemingly simple problem, it is difficult to find an
efficient algorithm in practice.
We propose an algorithm which is of complexity  $N^1\log N^0$, where $N^i$ is
the number of vertices of ${\hbox{${\cal T}$}_{h}^i}$, and which
is very fast for most practical 2D applications.
\bigskip

{\bf Algorithm }\\
 The method has 5 steps.
  First a quadtree is built containing all the vertices of mesh ${\cal T}_{h}^0$ such that in
 each terminal cell there are at least one, and at most 4, vertices of ${\cal T}_{h}^0$ .\\
For each $q^1$, vertex of ${\cal T}_{h}^1$ do:
\\\\
\begin{description}
\item[Step 1]
Find the terminal cell of the quadtree containing $q^1$.
 \item[Step 2] Find the the nearest vertex $q^0_j$ to $q^1$ in that cell.
 \item[Step 3] Choose one triangle $T_k^0\in{\cal T}_{h}^0$ which has $q^0_j$ for vertex.
 \item[Step 4] Compute the barycentric coordinates $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1,2,3}
 $ of $q^1$ in $T^0_k$.
\begin{itemize}
 \item{$-$} if all barycentric coordinates are positive, go to Step 5
 \item{$-$} else if one barycentric coordinate $\lambda_i$ is negative replace $T^0_k$ by the
 adjacent triangle opposite $q^0_i$ and go to Step 4.
 \item{$-$} else two barycentric coordinates are negative so take one of the two randomly
 and replace $T^0_k$ by the adjacent triangle as above.
\end{itemize}
  \item[Step 5] Calculate $g(q^1)$ on $T^0_k$ by linear interpolation of $f$:
 $$
 g(q^1) = \sum_{j=1,2,3} \lambda_j f(q^0_j)
 $$
 \item[End]~
\end{description}
\plot[height=5cm]{fastInterpolat}{
 To interpolate a function at $q^0$ the knowledge of the triangle
which contains $q^0$ is needed.  The algorithm may start at $q^1\in T_k^0$ and stall
on the boundary (thick line) because the line $q^0q^1$ is not inside $\Omega$. But if the holes
are triangulated too (doted line) then the problem does not arise.}

Two problems need to be solved:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it  What if $q^1$ is not in $\Omega^0_h$ ?}  Then Step 5 will stop with a
 boundary triangle. So we add a step which test the distance of $q^1$ with the
 two adjacent boundary edges and select the nearest, and so on till the distance
 grows.
 \medskip
 \item {\it What if $\Omega^0_h$ is not convex and the marching process of Step 4
 locks on a boundary?}
 By construction  Delaunay-Vorono\"{i} mesh generators always triangulate the convex
 hull of the vertices of the domain.  So we make sure that this information is not
 lost when ${\cal T}_{h}^0,{\cal T}_{h}^1$ are constructed and we keep the triangles which are
 outside the domain in a special list. Hence in step 5 we can use that list
 to step over holes if needed.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
 Some time in rare case the interpolation process miss some point, we cane change the

 @searchMethod=2; //  use alway the  brute force very very expensive  
\eFF
\end{note}
\begin{note}
 Step 3 requires an array of pointers
 such that each vertex points to one triangle
 of the triangulation.

\subsection{Keywords: Problem and Solve}

 For \freefempp  a problem must be given in variational form, %\cite{blop},
 so we need a bilinear form $a(u,v)$ , a linear form $\ell(f,v)$,
and possibly a boundary condition form must be added.
 \index{problem}
\bFF
@problem P(u,v) =
     a(u,v) - $\ell$(f,v)
     + (boundary condition);

\subsubsection{Weak form and Boundary Condition}

To present the principles  of Variational Formulations or also called weak forms fr the PDEs,
let us take a model problem : a Poisson equation with  Dirichlet and Robin Boundary condition
\index{Dirichlet}\index{Robin}.

The problem is: Find $u$ a real function defined on  domain $\Omega$ of $\R^d$ $(d=2,3)$ such that

\begin{equation} -  \nabla.(\kappa \nabla u) = f  , \quad \mbox{in}\quad \Omega, \quad
 a u + \kappa \frac{\p u}{\p n} = b \quad\mbox{on}\quad \Gamma_r, \quad
 u = g  \quad\mbox{on}\quad \Gamma_d
 \end{equation}

where
\begin{itemize}
\item if $d=2$ then  $ \nabla.(\kappa \nabla u) = \p_x(\kappa \p_x u ) + \p_y(\kappa \p_y u ) $
with $ \p_x u = \frac{\p u}{\p x}$
and $\p_y u = \frac{\p u}{\p y}$
\item if $d=3$ then $ \nabla.(\kappa \nabla u) = \p_x(\kappa \p_x u ) + \p_y(\kappa \p_y u ) +  \p_z(\kappa \p_z u ) $
with $ \p_x u = \frac{\p u}{\p x}$
, $\p_y u = \frac{\p u}{\p y}$ and , $\p_z u = \frac{\p u}{\p z}$

\item the border $\Gamma=\p \Omega$ is split in $\Gamma_d$ and $\Gamma_n$
such that $\Gamma_d \cap \Gamma_n = \emptyset$ and $ \Gamma_d \cup \Gamma_n = \p \Omega$,
\item $\kappa$ is a given positive function, such that $\exists \kappa_0 \in \R ,\quad 0 < \kappa_0  \leq \kappa $.
\item  $a$ a given non negative function,
\item  $ b$ a given function.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}{} This is the well known
Neumann boundary condition  if  $a=0$, and if $\Gamma_d$ is empty.
In this case the function appears in the problem just by its derivatives, so it is defined only up to a constant
 (if $u$ is a solution then  $ u+ c$ is also a solution).
\end{note}

Let  ${ v} $  a regular test function  null  on  $\Gamma_d$ , by integration by parts we get
 \begin{equation}-\int_{\Omega}  \nabla.(\kappa \nabla  u) \, { v} \,d\omega = \int_{\Omega}  \kappa \nabla{ v} . \nabla u  \,d\omega  - \int_{\Gamma} {v}
 \kappa \frac{  \p u}{\p \bm{n}}  \,d\gamma,= \int_{\Omega} f {v}  \,d\omega 
  \end{equation}

where if $d=2$ the $ \nabla{ v} . \nabla u = (\frac{\p u}{\p x}\frac{\p { v}}{\p x}
+\frac{\p u}{\p y}\frac{\p { v}}{\p y})$ ,
where if $d=3$ the $ \nabla{ v} . \nabla u = (\frac{\p u}{\p x}\frac{\p { v}}{\p x}
+\frac{\p u}{\p y}\frac{\p { v}}{\p y} + \frac{\p u}{\p z}\frac{\p { v}}{\p z})$ ,
and where $\bm{n}$ is the unitary outside normal of $\p\Omega$.

Now we note that $ \kappa \frac{  \p u}{\p n} = - a u + g $  on $\Gamma_r$
and $  v = 0 $ on $ \Gamma_d $ and $ \p \Omega = \Gamma_d \cup \Gamma_n $
thus
$$
  - \int_{\p \Omega} {v}
 \kappa \frac{  \p u}{\p n} = \int_{\Gamma_r} a u v - \int_{\Gamma_r} b v
$$

The problem becomes:

Find   $u \in V_g = \{v \in H^1(\Omega) / v = g \mbox{ on } \Gamma_d \} $  such that
\begin{equation} {\int_{\Omega} \kappa \nabla{ v} . \nabla u  \,d\omega
 + \int_{\Gamma_r} a u v  \,d\gamma = \int_{\Omega} f {v}}  \,d\omega  + \int_{\Gamma_r} b v  \,d\gamma , \quad \forall v \in V_0 \label{eq:v-poisson}
\end{equation}

where  $  V_0 = \{v \in H^1(\Omega) / v = 0 \mbox{ on } \Gamma_d \} $

Except in the case of Neumann conditions everywhere, the problem (\ref{eq:v-poisson}) is well posed when $\kappa\geq \kappa_0>0$.

\begin{note}
\label{note:fu}
\rm
If we have only Neumann boundary condition, 
linear algebra tells us that the right hand side must be orthogonal to the kernel of
the operator for the solution to exist.  One way of writing the compatibility condition is: \index{compatibility condition}
$$
 \int_{\Omega} f   \,d\omega  + \int_{\Gamma} b \,d\gamma=0
$$
and a way to fix the constant is to solve for $u \in H^1(\Omega)$ such that:
\begin{equation}
 {\int_{\Omega} \varepsilon u v \,\,d\omega\; + \; \kappa \nabla{ v} . \nabla u  \,d\omega
  = \int_{\Omega} f {v}}  \,d\omega  + \int_{\Gamma_r} b v  \,d\gamma , \quad \forall v \in H^1(\Omega) \label{eq:v-poisson-N}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter ( $ \sim 10^{-10}$ ).

Remark that if the solution
is of order $ \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ then the compatibility condition is unsatisfied, otherwise
we get the solution such that $\int_\Omega u = 0 $, you can also add a Lagrange multiplier to solver
the real mathemaical probleme like in the \verb!examples++-tutorial/Laplace-lagrange-mult.edp!
example.
\end{note}

In \texttt{FreeFem++},  the bidimensional problem (\ref{eq:v-poisson}) becomes
\bFF
 @ problem Pw(u,v) =
       @int2d(Th)( kappa*( dx(u)*dx(u) +  dy(u)*dy(u)) )  // $\int_{\Omega} \kappa \nabla{v} . \nabla u  \,d\omega$ \hfilll
     + @int1d(Th,gn)( a * u*v )                        // $\int_{\Gamma_r} a u v  \,d\gamma$  \hfilll

\eFF
where \texttt{Th} is a mesh of the the bidimensional  domain $\Omega$, and \texttt{gd} and \texttt{gn} are respectively the
boundary label of boundary $\Gamma_d$ and $\Gamma_n$.

\index{int3d}
And the the three dimensional problem (\ref{eq:v-poisson}) becomes

     + @int2d(Th,gn)( a * u*v )                        // $\int_{\Gamma_r} a u v  \,d\gamma$  \hfilll
     - @int3d(Th)(f*v)                                 // $\int_{\Omega} f v  \,d\omega $ \hfilll

\eFF
where \texttt{Th} is a mesh of the three dimensional  domain $\Omega$, and \texttt{gd} and \texttt{gn} are respectively the
boundary label of boundary $\Gamma_d$ and $\Gamma_n$.

Let $D$ be a $N$-dimensional bounded domain.
For an arbitrary polynomial $f$ of degree $r$,
if we can find particular (quadrature) points $\vec{\xi}_j,\, j=1,\cdots,J$ in $D$ and
(quadrature) constants $\omega_j$ such that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:GaussInt}
\int_{D}f(\vec{x}) = \sum_{\ell =1}^L c_\ell f(\vec{\xi}_\ell)
\end{eqnarray}
then we have an error estimate (see Crouzeix-Mignot (1984)),
and then there exists a constant $C>0$ such that,
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:GaussIntError}
\left|\int_{D}f(\vec{x}) - \sum_{\ell =1}^L \omega_\ell
f(\vec{\xi}_\ell )\right|
\le C|D|h^{r+1}

where $h$ is the diameter of $D$ and $|D|$ its measure (a point in the segment $[q^iq^j]$ is given as
\[
\{(x,y)|\; x=(1-t)q^i_x+tq^j_x,\, y=(1-t)q^i_y+tq^j_y,\, 0\le t\le 1\}

\subsection{Variational Form, Sparse Matrix, PDE Data Vector}
  \index{varf}\index{array}
 In \freefempp it is possible to define variational forms, and use them to build matrices
  and vectors and store them to speed-up the script (4 times faster here).

  For example let us solve the Thermal Conduction problem of section \ref{ss Thermal Conduction}.

 The variational formulation is  in $L^2(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$;
  we shall seek $u^n$ satisfying
\[
\forall w \in V_{0}; \qquad   \int_\Omega \frac{u^n-u^{n-1}}{\delta t} w + \kappa\n u^n\n w) +\int_\Gamma\alpha(u^n-u_{ue})w=0
\]
where $ V_0 = \{w\in H^1(\Omega)/ w_{|\Gamma_{24}}=0\}$.

So the to code the method with the matrices $A=(A_{ij})$, $M=(M_{ij})$, and  the vectors
$ u^n, b^n, b',b", b_{cl}$
( notation if $w$ is a vector then $w_i$ is a component of the vector).
\def\tgv{{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}}}
\begin{equation} u^n = A^{-1} b^n, \quad
  \quad b' = b_0 + M u^{n-1},
  \quad b"=  \tgv \; b_{cl} ,
  \quad  b^n_i = \left\{
  \begin{array}{cl}   b"_i  & \mbox{if }\ i \in \Gamma_{24} \\
                       b'_i & \mbox{else if } \not\in \Gamma_{24} \end{array}\right.
                       \label{eq tgv}  \end{equation}
Where with $ \tgv = \mathtt{tgv} = 10^{30}$ :
\begin{eqnarray}

Create three variational formulation, and build the matrices $A$,$M$.\label{matrix-varf}
\bFF
@varf vthermic (u,v)= @int2d(Th)(u*v/dt + k*(dx(u) * dx(v) + dy(u) * dy(v)))
            +  @int1d(Th,1,3)(alpha*u*v) + @on(2,4,u=1);

@varf vthermic0(u,v) =   @int1d(Th,1,3)(alpha*ue*v);

@varf vMass (u,v)= @int2d(Th)( u*v/dt)  + on(2,4,u=1);

@real tgv = 1e30;
@matrix A= vthermic(Vh,Vh,tgv=tgv,solver=CG);
@matrix M= vMass(Vh,Vh);
\eFF

Now, to build the right hand size we need 4 vectors.

\bFF

@real[int]  b0  = vthermic0(0,Vh); // constant part of the RHS
@real[int]  bcn = vthermic(0,Vh); //  tgv on Dirichlet boundary  node  ( !=0 )
// we have for the node $i$ : $i\in \Gamma_{24}  \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad bcn[i] \ne 0 $
@real[int]  bcl=tgv*u0[]; //  the Dirichlet boundary condition part


\eFF

\begin{note} The boundary condition \index{boundary condition} is implemented
 by penalization and vector \texttt{bcn} contains
 the contribution of the boundary condition $u_=1$ ,
so to change the boundary condition,
we have just to multiply the vector $bc[]$ by the current value $f$
 of the new boundary condition term by term
with the operator \texttt{.*}.\index{.*@\verb=.*=}
\refSec{Uzawa} \texttt{Examples++-tutorial/StokesUzawa.edp}  gives
 a real example of using all this features.
\end{note}


And the new version of the algorithm is now:
\bFF
@ofstream ff("thermic.dat");
@for(real t=0;t<T;t+=dt){
    @real[int] b = b0 ; // for the  RHS
    b += M*u[]; //  add the the time dependent part
    // lock boundary part:
    b = bcn ? bcl  : b ; // do $\forall i$:  b[i] =  bcn[i] ? bcl[i] : b[i]  ;
    u[] = A^-1*b;
    ff << t <<" "<<u(3,0.5)<<endl;
   @ plot(u);
}
@for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
  @cout<<dy(u)(6.0*i/20.0,0.9)<<endl;
@plot(u,fill=true,wait=1,ps="thermic.eps");
\eFF






\begin{note} \label{varf param}
 The functions appearing in the variational form are formal and local to the \texttt{varf} definition,
  the only important thing is the order in the parameter list, like in
\bFF
 @varf vb1([u1,u2],q) = @int2d(Th)( (dy(u1)+dy(u2)) *q) + int2d(Th)(1*q);
 @varf vb2([v1,v2],p) = @int2d(Th)( (dy(v1)+dy(v2)) *p) + int2d(Th)(1*p);
\eFF
\end{note}
\index{varf!array}\index{varf!matrix}

To build matrix $A$ from the bilinear part the variational form $a$ of type \ttCC{@varf}  simply write:
\index{matrix!varf}
\bFF
  A = a(Vh,Wh [, ...] );
 // where \hfilll
 //Vh is "fespace" for the unknow fields  with a correct number of component\hfilll
 //Wh is "fespace" for the test fields  with a correct number of component\hfilll
\eFF

Possible named parameters in \texttt{" [, ... ] "} are
\begin{description}
    \item[solver=]   \texttt{LU}, \texttt{CG}, \index{matrix!varf!solver=}
    \texttt{Crout}, \texttt{Cholesky}, \texttt{GMRES}, \texttt{sparsesolver}, \texttt{UMFPACK} ...

    The default solver is \texttt{GMRES}.

    The storage mode of the matrix of the underlying linear system
    depends on
    the type of solver chosen; for \texttt{LU}  the matrix is sky-line non
    symmetric, for \texttt{Crout} the matrix is sky-line symmetric, for
    \texttt{Cholesky} the matrix is sky-line symmetric positive
    definite,  for \texttt{CG}   the matrix is sparse symmetric positive,
    and for \texttt{GMRES}, \texttt{sparsesolver} or \texttt{UMFPACK} the matrix is just  sparse.

    \item[factorize =] \index{matrix!varf!solver=factorize} if true then do the matrix factorization for
    \texttt{LU}, \texttt{Cholesky} or \texttt{Crout}, the default value is $false$.

    \item[eps=]  \index{matrix!varf!eps=}   a real expression. $\varepsilon$  sets the stopping test for
    the iterative methods like \texttt{CG}. Note that if $\varepsilon$
    is negative  then the stopping test is:
    $$  || A x - b || < |\varepsilon| $$
    if it is positive then the stopping test is
        $$  || A x - b || < \frac{|\varepsilon|}{|| A x_{0} - b ||} $$


    \item[precon=]  \index{matrix!varf!precon=} name of a function (for example \texttt{P}) to set the preconditioner. \index{precon=}
    The prototype for the function \texttt{P} must be
\bFF
    @func @real[@int]  P(@real[@int] & xx) ;
\eFF
      \item[tgv=]  \index{matrix!varf!tgv=}    Huge value ($10^{30}$) used to implement
      Dirichlet boundary conditions.

      \item[tolpivot=] \index{matrix!varf!tolpivot =}  set the tolerance of the pivot in UMFPACK ($10^-1$)  and, LU, Crout, Cholesky
      factorisation ($10^{-20}$).

      \item[tolpivotsym=] \index{problem!tolpivotsym =} \index{solve!tolpivotsym=} set the tolerance of the pivot sym in UMFPACK
      \item[strategy=] \index{problem!strategy =} \index{solve!strategy=} set the integer UMFPACK strategy  ($0$ by default).

\end{description}


\begin{note}
The line of the matrix corresponding to the space \ttCC{Wh} and the
column of the matrix corresponding to the space \ttCC{Vh}.
\end{note}

To build the dual vector b (of type real[int])  from the linear part of the variational form $a$ do simply
\index{array!varf}
\bFF
  @real b(Vh.ndof);
  b = a(0,Vh);
\eFF

A first example to compute the area of each triangle $K$ of mesh $Th$,  just do:

\bFF
  @fespace Nh(Th,P0); // the  space function constant / triangle
   Nh areaK;
   @varf varea(unused,chiK) =  @int2d(Th)(chiK);	
   etaK[]= varea(0,Ph);
\eFF
Effectively, the basic functions of space $Nh$, are the characteristic function
of the element of Th, and the numbering is the numeration of the element,
so by construction:
$$
 \mathtt{etaK}[i] = \int {1}_{|K_i} = \int_{K_i} 1;
 $$

Now, we can use this to compute error indicators like in examples
\texttt{AdaptResidualErrorIndi\-cator.edp} in directory \texttt{examples++-tutorial}.

First to compute a continuous approximation to the function $h$ "density mesh size"  of the mesh $Th$.

\index{qfnbpE=}
\bFF
  @fespace Vh(Th,P1);
   Vh h ;
   @real[int]  count(Th.nv); 	
   @varf vmeshsizen(u,v)=@intalledges(Th,qfnbpE=1)(v);
   @varf vedgecount(u,v)=intalledges(Th,qfnbpE=1)(v/lenEdge);
   //	  computation of the mesh size
   //   -----------------------------
   count=@vedgecount(0,Vh); // number of edge / vertex
   h[]=@vmeshsizen(0,Vh); //  sum length edge / vertex
   h[]=h[]./count; // mean lenght edge / vertex 	
\eFF


To compute error indicator for Poisson equation :
$$
{ \eta_K =   \int_K h_K^2 |( f + \Delta u_h)|^2  + \int_{\partial K} h_e |[ \frac{\partial u_h}{\partial n} ]|^2  }
$$
where $ h_K$ is size of the longest edge (\ttCC{hTriangle}), $h_e$ is the size of the current edge (\ttCC{lenEdge}), $n$ the
normal.

\bFF
  @fespace Nh(Th,P0); // the  space function contant / triangle
   Nh etak;
  @varf vetaK(unused,chiK) =
       @intalledges(Th)(chiK*lenEdge*@square(jump(N.x*dx(u)+N.y*dy(u))))
      +@int2d(Th)(chiK*@square(hTriangle*(f+dxx(u)+dyy(u))) );

We add automatic \x{expression optimization} by default, if this optimization creates problems,
it can be removed with the keyword \texttt{{optimize}} as in the following example : \index{optimize=}
\index{varf!optimize=}
\bFF
@varf a(u1,u2)= @int2d(Th,optimize=false)(  dx(u1)*dx(u2) + dy(u1)*dy(u2) )
                    +  @on(1,2,4,u1=0)  +  @on(3,u1=1) ;

Remark, it is all possible to build interpolation matrix, like in
\index{interpolate}\index{matrix!interpolate}
the following example:
\bFF
@mesh  TH = square(3,4);
@mesh  th = square(2,3);
@mesh  Th = square(4,4);


@fespace VH(TH,P1);
@fespace Vh(th,P1);
@fespace Wh(Th,P1);

@matrix B= @interpolate(VH,Vh);  // build interpolation matrix Vh->VH 
@matrix BB= @interpolate(Wh,Vh);  // build interpolation matrix  Vh->Wh 
\eFF 
and after some operations on sparse matrices are
available for example
 \bFF
  @int N=10;
  @real [int,int] A(N,N);  // a full matrix
  @real [int] a(N),b(N);
  A =0;
  @for (int i=0;i<N;i++)
    {
      A(i,i)=1+i;
      @if(i+1 < N)    A(i,i+1)=-i;
      a[i]=i;
    }
  b=A*b;
  @cout << "xxxx\n";
  @matrix sparseA=A;
  @cout << sparseA << endl;
  sparseA = 2*sparseA+sparseA';
  sparseA = 4*sparseA+sparseA*5; 
  @matrix sparseB=sparseA+sparseA+sparseA; ;
  @cout << "sparseB = " << sparseB(0,0) << endl;
\eFF


\subsection{Interpolation matrix}

It is also possible to store the matrix of a linear interpolation operator from
 a finite element space $V_h$ to  another $W_h$ to  \texttt{interpolate($W_h$,$V_h$,...)} a function.
Note that the continuous finite functions are extended by continuity
 outside of the domain.
	
The named parameters of function \texttt{interpolate} are:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{inside=}] set true to create zero-extension.
\item[\texttt{t=}] set true to get the transposed matrix
\item[\texttt{op=}] set an integer written below
\begin{description}
\item[0] the default value and interpolate of the function
\item[1] interpolate the $\p_x$
\item[2] interpolate the $\p_y$
\item[3] interpolate the $\p_z$
\end{description}
\item[\texttt{U2Vc=}] set the which is the  component of $W_h$ come in $V_h$ in interpolate  process in a int array
so the size of the array is number of component of $W_h$, if the put $-1$ then component is set to $0$, like in the following example:
(by default the component number is unchanged). 
\bFF
@fespace V4h(Th4,[P1,P1,P1,P1]);
@fespace V3h(Th,[P1,P1,P1]);
@int[@int] u2vc=[1,3,-1];// -1 => put zero on the component 
@matrix IV34= @interpolate(V3h,V4h,inside=0,U2Vc=u2vc);//  V3h <- V4h 
V4h [a1,a2,a3,a4]=[1,2,3,4];
V3h [b1,b2,b3]=[10,20,30];
b1[]=IV34*a1[]; 
\eFF
So here we have:
\texttt{
b1 == 2,  b2 == 4, b3 == 0}
 \index{inside=}\index{interpolate!inside=}
 \index{interpolate!t=}\index{interpolate!t=}.
 \index{interpolate!op=}\index{interpolate!op=}.
\end{description}

\begin{example}[mat\_interpol.edp]~
\bFF
@mesh Th=@square(4,4);
@mesh Th4=@square(2,2,[x*0.5,y*0.5]);
@plot(Th,Th4,ps="ThTh4.eps",wait=1);
@fespace Vh(Th,P1);     @fespace Vh4(Th4,P1);
@fespace Wh(Th,P0);     @fespace Wh4(Th4,P0);

@matrix IV= @interpolate(Vh,Vh4); //  here the function is
// exended by continuity
@cout << " IV Vh<-Vh4 " << IV << endl;
Vh v, vv;          Vh4 v4=x*y;
v=v4;              vv[]= IV*v4[];   // here   v  == vv    =>
@real[int]  diff= vv[] - v[];
@cout << " || v - vv || = " <<  diff.linfty << endl;
@assert( diff.linfty<= 1e-6);
@matrix IV0= interpolate(Vh,Vh4,inside=1); // here the function is
// exended by zero
@cout << " IV Vh<-Vh4 (inside=1)  " << IV0 << endl;
@matrix IVt0= interpolate(Vh,Vh4,inside=1,t=1);
@cout << " IV Vh<-Vh4^t (inside=1)  " << IVt0 << endl;
@matrix IV4t0= interpolate(Vh4,Vh);
@cout << " IV Vh4<-Vh^t  " << IV4t0 << endl;
@matrix IW4= interpolate(Wh4,Wh);
@cout << " IV Wh4<-Wh  " << IW4  << endl;
@matrix IW4V= interpolate(Wh4,Vh);
@cout << " IV Wh4<-Vh  " << IW4  << endl;
\eFF
\end{example}

 Build interpolation matrix $A$ at a array of  points $(xx[j],yy[j]),  i = 0, 2$ here
$$  a_ij = dop(w^i_c (xx[j],yy[j]))$$
where $w_i$ is the basic finite element  function, $c$ the component number, $dop$ the type 
of diff operator like in op def. 
\bFF
@real[int] xx=[.3,.4],yy=[.1,.4];
int c=0,dop=0; 
@matrix Ixx= interpolate(Vh,xx,yy,op=dop,composante=c);
@cout << Ixx << endl;
Vh ww;
@real[int] dd=[1,2]; 
ww[]= Ixx*dd;
\eFF

\subsection{Finite elements connectivity}
Here, we show how to get  informations on a finite element space $W_h({\cal T}_n,*)$, where ``*'' may be P1, P2, P1nc, etc.
\index{nt} \index{ndof} \index{ndofK} \index{connectivity}
\index{FEspace!nt}\index{FEspace!ndof} \index{FEspace!(int ,int )}
\begin{itemize}
\item   \ttCC{Wh.nt}  gives the \x{number of element} of $W_h$
\item   \ttCC{   Wh.ndof}  gives the \x{number of degrees of freedom} or unknown
\item   \ttCC{   Wh.ndofK }  gives the number of degrees of freedom on one element
\item   \ttCC{   Wh(k,i) }   gives the number of $i$th  degrees of freedom of element $k$.
\end{itemize}
See the following  example:
\begin{example}[FE.edp]
\bFF
@mesh Th=@square(5,5);
@fespace Wh(Th,P2);
@cout << " nb of degree of freedom           : " << Wh.ndof << endl;
@cout << " nb of degree of freedom / ELEMENT : " << Wh.ndofK << endl;
 @int k= 2, kdf= Wh.ndofK ;;  // element 2
 @cout << " df of element " << k << ":" ;
 @for (@int i=0;i<kdf;i++)  @cout << Wh(k,i) << " ";
 @cout << @endl;
\eFF
\end{example}
The output is:
\bFF
 Nb Of Nodes = 121
 Nb of DF = 121
 FESpace:Gibbs: old skyline = 5841  new skyline = 1377
 nb of degree of freedom           : 121
 nb of degree of freedom / ELEMENT : 6
 df of element 2:78 95 83 87 79 92
\eFF

\section{Visualization}
Results created by the finite element method can be a  huge set of data, so it is very important to
render them easy to grasp.
There are two ways of visualization in \freefempp:
One, the default view, supports the drawing of meshes, isovalues of real  FE-functions
and of vector fields, all by the command \ttCC{@plot} (see \refSec{Plot} below).
For publishing purpose, \freefempp can store these plots as postscript files.

Another method is to use external tools, for example, gnuplot
(see Section \ref{sec:gnuplot}), medit (see Section \ref{sec:medit})
 using the command \ttCC{@system} to launch them and/or to save the data in text files.

\index{plot}
\subsection{Plot} \index{sec:Plot}\label{sec:Plot}
   With the command plot, meshes, isovalues of scalar functions and vector fields can be displayed.

The parameters of the plot command can be , meshes, real FE functions ,
arrays of 2  real FE functions, arrays of two arrays of double, to plot
respectively a mesh, a function, a vector field, or a curve defined by the two arrays of double.

Example \ref{membran} shows how to generate a gnu-plot from a \freefempp file.  Let us present here
another technique which has the advantage of being online, i.e. one doesn't need to quit \freefempp

But this work only if gnuplot\footnote{\url{http://www.gnuplot.info/}} is installed , and

 \subsection{conjugate Gradient/GMRES}

Suppose we want to solve  the Euler problem (here $x$ has nothing to do with the reserved variable for the first coordinate in \freefempp): find $ x\in \R^n $  such that
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:dJ=0}
\nabla J(x) = \left(\frac{\p J}{\p x_i} (\vec{x})\right) = 0
\end{equation}
where $ J$ is a functional (to minimize  for example) from  $ \R^n$ to $ \R$.

If the function is convex we can use the conjugate gradient to solve the problem,
and we just need the function (named \texttt{dJ} for example)
which compute $\nabla J$, so the parameters
are the name of that function with prototype

 \ttCC{@func\ @real[@int]\  dJ(@real[@int] \& xx);}
 
 which compute $\nabla J$, and
a vector \ttCC{x} of type ( of course the number 20 can be changed)

 \ttCC{@real[@int] x(20);} 
 
 to initialize the process and get the result.
\\\\
Given an initial value $\vec{x}^{(0)}$, a maximum number $i_{\max}$
of iterations, and an error tolerance $0<\epsilon<1$:
Put $\vec{x}=\vec{x}^{(0)}$ and write
\begin{quote}\texttt{
NLCG($\nabla J$, $\vec{x}$, precon$=M$, nbiter$=i_{\max}$, eps$=\epsilon$);
}
\end{quote}
will give the solution of $\vec{x}$ of $\nabla J(\vec{x})=0$.
We can omit parameters \texttt{precon, nbiter, eps}.
Here $M$ is the preconditioner whose default is the identity matrix.
The stopping test is
\[
\| \nabla J(\vec{x})\|_P\le \epsilon\| \nabla J(\vec{x}^{(0)})\|_P
\]
Writing the minus value in \texttt{eps=}, i.e.,
\begin{quote}\texttt{
NLCG($\nabla J$, $\vec{x}$, precon$=M$, nbiter$=i_{\max}$, eps$=-\epsilon$);
}
\end{quote}
we can use the stopping test
\[
\| \nabla J(\vec{x})\|_P^2\le \epsilon
\]
The  parameters of these three functions are:

For a given symmetric positive matrix $A$, consider the quadratic form
\[
J(\vec{x})=\frac{1}{2}\vec{x}^TA\vec{x}-\vec{b}^T\vec{x}
\]
then $J(\vec{x})$ is minimized by the solution $\vec{x}$ of $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$.
In this case, we can use the function \texttt{LinearCG}
\begin{quote}\texttt{
LinearCG($A$, $\vec{x}$, precon$=M$, nbiter$=i_{\max}$, eps$=\pm\epsilon$);
}
\end{quote}
If $A$ is not symmetric, we can use GMRES(Generalized Minimum Residual) algorithm by
\begin{quote}\texttt{
LinearGMRES($A$, $\vec{x}$, precon$=M$, nbiter$=i_{\max}$, eps$=\pm\epsilon$);
}
\end{quote}
Also, we can use the non-linear version of GMRES algorithm
(the functional $J$ is just convex)
\begin{quote}\texttt{
LinearGMRES($\nabla J$, $\vec{x}$, precon$=M$, nbiter$=i_{\max}$, eps$=\pm\epsilon$);
}
\end{quote}
For detail of these algorithms, refer to \cite{Lucquin}[Chapter IV, 1.3].

\subsection{Algorithms for Unconstrained Optimization}
Two algorithms of
COOOL  a package \cite{coool} are interfaced with
the Newton Raphson method  (call \texttt{Newton}) and
the  \texttt{BFGS} method. \index{Newton}\index{BFGS}
These two ones are directly available in FreeFem (no dynamical link to load).
Be careful with these algorithms, because their
implementation uses full matrices. We also provide several
optimization algorithms from the NLopt library  \cite{nlopt} as well 
as an interface for Hansen's  implementation of CMAES 
(a MPI version of this one is also available). These last algorithms can
be found as dynamical links in the \texttt{example++-load} folder
as the \texttt{ff-NLopt} and \texttt{CMA\_ES} files (\texttt{CMA\_ES\_MPI}
from the \texttt{example++-mpi} folder for the mpi version).

\subsubsection{Example of utilization for BFGS or CMAES}
%\begin{example}[{algo.edp}
\bFF
  @real[int] b(10),u(10);
  @func @real J(@real[int] & u)
    {
      @real s=0;
      @for (@int i=0;i<u.n;i++)
          s +=(i+1)*u[i]*u[i]*0.5 - b[i]*u[i];
      @cout << "J ="<< s << " u =" <<  u[0] << " " << u[1] << "...\n" ;
      @return s;
    }

//  the grad of J (this is a affine version (the RHS is in  )
  @func @real[int] DJ(@real[int] &u)
    {
      @for (@int i=0;i<u.n;i++)
        u[i]=(i+1)*u[i]-b[i];
      @return u;  // return of global variable ok
    };

  b=1; u=2; // set  right hand side and initial gest
  @BFGS(J,dJ,u,eps=1.e-6,nbiter=20,nbiterline=20);
  @cout << "BFGS: J(u) = " << J(u) << endl;

\eFF
%\end{example}

Using the CMA evolution strategy is almost the same, except that, as it is
a derivative free optimizer, the \texttt{dJ} argument is omitted and there are
some other named parameters to control the behaviour of the algorithm. With the same 
objective function as above, an example of utilization would be (see \texttt{cmaes-VarIneq.edp} for a complete example):
\bFF
  @load "ff-cmaes"
  ... //define J, u and all here
  @real min = cmaes(J,u,stopTolFun=1e-6,stopMaxIter=3000);
  @cout << "minimal value is " << min << " for u = " << u << @endl;
\eFF
This algorithm works with a normal multivariate distribution in the parameters
space and try to adapt its covariance matrix using the information provides by
the successive function evaluations (see \cite{hansen} for more details). Thus, some specific parameters can be passed
to control the starting distribution, size of the sample generations etc... Named parameters
for this are the following :
\index{CMAES}
\begin{description}

    \item[\texttt{seed=}] Seed for random number generator  \index{CMAES!seed=}
    ({\tt val} is an integer). No specified value will lead to a clock based seed initialization.
    
    \item[\texttt{initialStdDev=}] Value for the standard deviations of the initial covariance matrix \index{CMAES!initialStdDev=}
    ({\tt val} is a real). If the value $\sigma$ is passed, the initial covariance matrix will be set to $\sigma I$. The 
            expected initial distance between initial $X$ and the $argmin$
            should be roughly initialStdDev. Default is $0.3$.
    
    \item[\texttt{initialStdDevs=}] Same as above except that the argument is an array allowing to set a value of the initial standard deviation
    for each parameter. Entries differing by several orders of magnitude should be avoided (if it can't be, try rescaling the problem).
    
    \item[\texttt{stopTolFun=}]  Stops the algorithm if function values differences are smaller than the passed one, default is $10^{-12}$.
    
    \item[\texttt{stopTolFunHist=}]  Stops the algorithm if function value differences of the best values are smaller than the passed one, default is $0$ (unused).
    
    \item[\texttt{stopTolX=}]  Stopping criteria triggered if step sizes in the parameters space are 
                 smaller than this real value, default is $0$.
                 
    \item[\texttt{stopTolXFactor=}]  Stopping criteria triggered when the standard deviation increases more than this value. The default value is $10^{3}$.
       
    \item[\texttt{stopMaxFunEval=}]  Stops the algorithm when {\tt stopMaxFunEval} function evaluations have been done. Set to $900(n+3)^{2}$ by default, where $n$ is the parameters space dimension .
                 
    \item[\texttt{stopMaxIter=}]  Integer stopping the search when {\tt stopMaxIter} generations has been sampled. Unused by default.
    
    \item[\texttt{popsize=}]  Integer value used to change the sample size. The default value is $4+ \lfloor 3\ln (n) \rfloor$, see \cite{hansen}
    for more details. Increasing the population size usually improves the global search capabilities at the cost of an at most linear reduction of the convergence speed with respect to {\tt popsize}.
    
    \item[\texttt{paramFile=}] This {\tt string} type parameter allows the user to pass all the parameters using an extern file as in Hansen's original code. More parameters related to the CMA-ES algorithm 
    can be changed with this file. A sample of it can be found in the {\tt examples++-load/ffCMAES/} folder under the name {\tt initials.par}. Note that the parameters passed to the CMAES function in the 
    FreeFem script will be ignored if an input parameters file is given.
                 
\end{description}





\subsection{IPOPT}
The {\tt ff-Ipopt} package is an interface for the IPOPT \cite{ipopt} optimizer. IPOPT is a software library for large scale, non-linear, constrained optimization. Detailed informations about it are in \cite{ipopt} and \url{https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt}. It implements a primal-dual interior point method along with filter method based line searchs. 
IPOPT need a direct sparse symmetric linear solver. If your version of FreeFem has been compiled with the {\tt --enable-downlad} tag, it will automatically be linked with a sequential version of MUMPS. An alternative to MUMPS would be to download the HSL subroutines (see \url{http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation/node16.html}) and place them in the {\tt /ipopt/Ipopt-3.10.2/ThirdParty/HSL} directory of the FreeFem++ downloads folder before compiling.

\subsubsection{Short description of the algorithm}
 In this section, we give a very brief glimpse at the underlying mathematics of IPOPT. For a deeper introduction on interior methods for nonlinear smooth optimization, one can consult \cite{ipintro}, or \cite{ipopt} for more IPOPT specific elements. For convenience, let us assume that the minimization problem is the following, given a function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$, find :
 \begin{equation}\label{minimproblem}
 \begin{array} {c}
 x_{0} = \underset{x\in V}{\operatorname{argmin}} f(x) \\
 \mathrm{with}\ V = \left\lbrace x\in\R^{n} \vert \forall i, 1\leq i \leq m, c_{i}(x) \geq 0 \right\rbrace 
 \end{array}
 \end{equation}
Generalization to mixed equality/inequality constraints can be found in \cite{ipintro} or \cite{ipopt}. The $f$ function as well as the constraints $c$ should be twice-continuously differentiable.


%For this optimization problem, the first order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, hold at the point $x^{*}$ if $\exists \lambda^{*}\in\R^{m}$ such that :
%\begin{equation}\label{KKT}
%\begin{array}{r c l}
%	\forall i,\  c_{i}(x^{*})& \geq &0 \\
%	\nabla f(x^{*}) & = & J_{c}(x^{*})^{T}\lambda^{*}\\
%	\forall i,\ \lambda_{i}^{*} & \geq & 0 \\
%	c(x^{*})\cdot\lambda^{*} &=&0
%\end{array}
%\end{equation}
%When certain assumptions upon the constraints are met (see \cite{ipintro}), these are necessary conditions for a point to be a solution of \ref{minimproblem}.
As a barrier method, interior point algorithms try to find a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point for \ref{minimproblem} by solving a sequence of unconstrained problems of the form :
\begin{equation}\label{barrier}
\mathrm{for\ a\ given\ }\mu > 0,\ \mathrm{find}\ x_{\mu} = \underset{x\in\R^{n}}{\operatorname{argmin}}\  f(x) - \displaystyle{\mu\sum_{i=1}^{m} \ln c_{i}(x)}
\end{equation}
If the sequence of barrier parameters $\mu$ converge to 0, intuition suggests that the sequence of minimizers of \ref{barrier} converge to a local constrained minimizer of \ref{minimproblem}. For a given $\mu$, \ref{barrier} is solved by finding $x_{\mu}\in\R^{n}$ such that :
\begin{equation}\label{muproblem}
 \nabla f(x_{\mu}) - \displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{\mu}{c_{i}(x_{\mu})}\nabla c_{i}(x_{\mu})}
 = \nabla f(x_{\mu}) - J_{c}(x_{\mu})^{T}
 \left(\begin{array}{c} \mu / c_{1}(x_{\mu}) \\ \vdots \\ \mu / c_{m}(x_{\mu}) \end{array}\right) = 0
\end{equation}
If we call $\lambda_{\mu}\in\R^{m}$ the vector of components $\lambda_{\mu,i} = \mu / c_{i}(x_{\mu})$, the upper condition can then be written as :
\begin{equation}\label{muproblemlambda}
 \nabla f(x_{\mu}) - J_{c}(x_{\mu})^{T}\lambda_{\mu}= 0
\end{equation}
It should remind something of the Lagrange multipliers, and indeed, when certain assumptions are met, when $\mu\rightarrow 0$, the $\lambda_{\mu, i}$ converge toward some suitable Lagrange multipliers for the KKT conditions. 


Equation \ref{muproblemlambda} is solved by performing a Newton method  in order to find a solution of \ref{muproblem} for each of the decreasing values of $\mu$. Some order 2 conditions are also taken into account to avoid convergence to local maximizer, see \cite{ipintro} for precision about them. In a classical IP algorithm, the Newton method is directly applied to \ref{muproblem}. This is in most case inefficient due to frequent computation of infeasible points. These difficulties are avoided in Primal-Dual interior point methods where \ref{muproblem} is transformed into an extended system where $\lambda_{\mu}$ is treated as an unknown (here again, details can be found in \cite{ipintro}).


More IPOPT specific features or implementation details can be found in \cite{ipopt}. We will just retain that IPOPT is a smart Newton method for solving constrained optimization problem. Thus, the optimization process requires expressions of all derivatives up to the order 2 of the fitness function as well as those of the constraints. For problems whose hessian are difficult to compute or leads to high dimension dense matrices, it is possible to use a BFGS approximation of these objects at the cost of a much slower convergence rate.


\subsubsection{IPOPT in FreeFem++}
Calling the IPOPT optimizer in a FreeFem++ script is done with the {\tt IPOPT} function included in the {\tt ff-Ipopt} dynamic library. IPOPT is designed to solve constrained minimization problem in the form :

 \begin{equation}\label{ipoptproblem}
 \begin{array} {r l}
 	\mathrm{find}& x_{0} = \underset{x\in\R^{n}}{\operatorname{argmin}} f(x) \\
 	\mathrm{s.t.}&\left\lbrace \begin{array}{l r}  \forall i\leq n,\ x_{i}^{\mathrm{lb}}\leq x_{i}\leq x_{i}^{\mathrm{ub}} & \mathrm{\  (simple\ bounds)} \\
	   \forall i\leq m,\ c_{i}^{\mathrm{lb}}\leq c_{i}(x)\leq c_{i}^{\mathrm{ub}} & \mathrm{(constraints\ functions)}
 \end{array}\right. \\
 
 \end{array}
 \end{equation}
Where $\mathrm{ub}$ and $\mathrm{lb}$ stand for "upper bound" and "lower bound". If for some $i, 1\leq i\leq m$ we have $c_{i}^{\mathrm{lb}} = c_{i}^{\mathrm{ub}}$, it means that $c_{i}$ is an equality constraint, and an inequality one if $c_{i}^{\mathrm{lb}} < c_{i}^{\mathrm{ub}}$.


There are different ways to pass the fitness function and constraints. The more general one is to define the functions using the keyword {\tt func}. Any returned matrix must be a sparse one (type {\tt matrix}, not a {\tt real[int,int]}) :
\bFF
  @func @real J(@real[@int] &X) {...} //Fitness Function, returns a scalar
  @func @real[@int] gradJ(@real[@int] &X) {...} //Gradient is a vector
  
  @func @real[int] C(@real[@int] &X) {...} //Constraints
  @func @matrix jacC(@real[@int] &X) {...} //Constraints jacobian
\eFF
\textbf{Warning 1} : in the current version of FreeFem++, returning a {\tt matrix} object local to a function block leads to undefined results. For each sparse matrix returning function you define, an extern matrix object has to be declared, whose associated function will overwrite and return on each call. Here is an example for {\tt jacC} :
\bFF
  @matrix jacCBuffer; //just declare, no need to define yet
  @func @matrix jacC(@real[@int] &X)
  {
    ...//fill jacCBuffer
    @return jacCBuffer;
  }
\eFF
\textbf{Warning 2}: IPOPT requires the structure of each matrix at the initialization of the algorithm. Some errors may occur if the matrices are not constant and are built with the {\tt matrix A = [I,J,C]} syntax, or with an intermediary full matrix ({\tt real[int,int]}), because any null coefficient is discarded during the construction of the sparse matrix. It is also the case when making matrices linear combinations, for which any zero coefficient will result in the suppression of the matrix from the combination. Some controls are available to avoid such problems. Check the named parameters descriptions ({\tt checkindex}, {\tt structhess} and {\tt structjac} can help). We strongly advice to use {\tt varf} as much as possible for the matrix forging.
\newline

The hessian returning function is somewhat different because it has to be the hessian of the lagrangian function : $(x,\sigma_{f},\lambda)\mapsto \sigma_{f}\nabla^{2}f(x) + \displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_{i}\nabla^{2}c_{i}(x)}$ where $\lambda\in\R^{m}$ and $\sigma\in\R$. Your hessian function should then have the following prototype :
\bFF
  @matrix hessianLBuffer; //just to keep it in mind
  @func @matrix hessianL(@real[@int] &X,@real sigma,@real[@int] &lambda) {...}
\eFF
If the constraints functions are all affine, or if there are only simple bounds constraints or no constraint at all, the lagrangian hessian is equal to the fitness function hessian, one can then omit the {\tt sigma} and {\tt lambda} parameters :
\bFF
  @matrix hessianJBuffer;
  @func @matrix hessianJ(@real[@int] &X) {...} //Hessian prototype when constraints are affine
\eFF
When these functions are defined, IPOPT is called this way :
\bFF
  @real[@int] Xi = ... ; //starting point
  @IPOPT(J,gradJ,hessianL,C,jacC,Xi, /*some named parameters*/ );
\eFF
If the hessian is omitted, the interface will tell IPOPT to use the (L)BFGS approximation (it can also be enabled with a named parameter, see further). Simple bounds or unconstrained problems do not require the constraints part, so the following expressions are valid :
\bFF
  @IPOPT(J,gradJ,C,jacC,Xi, ... ); //IPOPT with BFGS  
  @IPOPT(J,gradJ,hessianJ,Xi, ... );//Newton IPOPT without constraints
  @IPOPT(J,gradJ,Xi, ... );//BFGS, no constraints
\eFF

Simple bounds are passed using the {\tt lb} and {\tt ub} named parameters, while constraints bounds are passed with the {\tt clb} and {\tt cub} ones. Unboundedness in some directions can be achieved by using the $1e^{19}$ and $-1e^{19}$ values that IPOPT recognizes as $+\infty$ and $-\infty$ :
\bFF
  @real[@int] xlb(n),xub(n),clb(m),cub(m);
  ... //fill the arrays...
  @IPOPT(J,gradJ,hessianL,C,jacC,Xi,@lb=xlb,@ub=xub,@clb=clb,@cub=cub,  /*some other named parameters*/ );
\eFF

\textbf{P2 fitness function and affine constraints function :} In the case where the fitness function or constraints function can be expressed respectively in the following forms :
$$
\begin{array}{c c}
	\forall x\in\R^{n},\  f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\left\langle Ax,x \right\rangle + \left\langle b,x\right\rangle & (A,b)\in\mathcal{M}_{n,n}(\R)\times\R^{n} \\
	\mathrm{or} ,\ C(x) = Ax + b & (A,b)\in\mathcal{M}_{n,m}(\R)\times\R^{m} 
\end{array}
$$
where $A$ and $b$ are constant, it is possible to directly pass the $(A,b)$ pair instead of defining 3 (or 2) functions. It also indicates to IPOPT that some objects are constant and that they have to be evaluated only once, thus avoiding multiple copies of the same matrix. The syntax is :
\bFF
  //Affine constraints with "standard" fitness function
  @matrix A= ... ;//Linear part of the constraints
  @real[@int] b = ... ; //Constant part of constraints
  @IPOPT(J,gradJ,hessianJ, [A,b] ,Xi, /*bounds and named params*/); 
  //[b,A] would work as well... Scatterbrains pampering...
\eFF
Note that if you define the constraints in this way, they doesn't contribute to the hessian, so the hessian should only take one {\tt real[int]} as argument. 
\bFF
  //Affine constraints and P2 fitness func:
  @matrix A= ... ;//Bilinear form matrix
  @real[@int] b = ... ;//Linear contribution to f
  @matrix Ac= ... ;//Linear part of the constraints
  @real[@int] bc= ... ;//Constant part of constraints
  @IPOPT([A,b], [Ac,bc] ,Xi, /*bounds and named params*/);
\eFF
If both objective and constraints functions are given this way, it automatically activates the IPOPT {\tt mehrotra\_algorithm} option (better for linear and quadratric programming according to the documentation). Otherwise, this option can only be set through the option file (see the named parameters section). 

A spurious case is the one of defining $f$ in this manner while using standard functions for the constraints :
\bFF
  @matrix A= ... ;//Bilinear form matrix
  @real[@int] b = ... ;//Linear contribution to f
  @func @real[int] C(@real[@int] &X) {...} //Constraints
  @func @matrix jacC(@real[@int] &X) {...} //Constraints jacobian
  @IPOPT([A,b],C,jacC,Xi, /*bounds and named params*/);
\eFF
Indeed, when passing {\tt [A,b]} in order to define $f$, the lagrangian hessian is automatically build has the constant $x \mapsto A$ function, with no way to add possible constraints contributions, leading to incorrect second order derivatives. So, a problem should be defined like that in only two cases : 1) constraints are nonlinear but you want to use the BFGS mode (then add {\tt bfgs=1} to the named parameter), 2) constraints are affine, but in this case, why not passing them in the same way?

Here are some other valid definitions of the problem (cases when $f$ is a pure quadratic or linear form, or $C$ a pure linear function, etc...) :
\bFF
  //Pure quadratic f - A is a matrix:
  @IPOPT(A, /*constraints args*/, Xi, /*bounds and named params*/);
  //Pure linear f - b i a real[int] :
  @IPOPT(b, /*constraints args*/, Xi, /*bounds and named params*/);
  //linear constraints - Ac is a matrix
  @IPOPT(/*fitness func args*/, Ac, Xi, /*bounds and named params*/);
\eFF

\textbf{Returned Value :} The {\tt IPOPT} function returns an error code of type {\tt int}. A zero value is obtained when the algorithm succeeds and positive values reflects the fact that IPOPT encounters minor troubles. Negative values reveals more problematic cases. The associated IPOPT return tags are listed in the table below. The \href{https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt/browser/stable/3.10/Ipopt/doc/documentation.pdf?format=raw}{IPOPT pdf documentation} provides more accurate description of these return status :\newline

\textbf{Named Parameters :} The available named parameters in this interface are those we thought to be the most subject to variations from one optimization to another, plus a few ones that are interface specific. Though, as one could see at \url{http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation/node59.html}, there are many parameters that can be changed within IPOPT, affecting the algorithm behaviour. These parameters can still be controlled by placing an option file in the execution directory. Note that IPOPT's \href{https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt/browser/stable/3.10/Ipopt/doc/documentation.pdf?format=raw}{pdf documentation} may provides more informations than the previously mentioned online version for certain parameters. The in-script available parameters are :

\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{lb}, \texttt{ub} :] {\tt real[int]} for lower and upper simple bounds upon the search variables, must be of size $n$ (search space dimension). If two components of same index in these arrays are equal then the corresponding search variable is fixed. By default IPOPT will remove any fixed variable from the optimization process and always use the fixed value when calling functions. It can be changed using the {\tt fixedvar} parameter.
  \item[\texttt{clb}, \texttt{cub} :] {\tt real[int]} of size $m$ (number of constraints) for lower and upper constraints bounds. Equality between two components of same index $i$ in {\tt clb} and {\tt cub} reflect an equality constraint.
  \item[\texttt{structjacc} :] To pass the greatest possible structure (indexes of non null coefficients) of the constraints jacobian under the form {\tt [I,J]} where {\tt I} and {\tt J} are two integer arrays. If not defined, the structure of the constraints jacobian, evaluated in {\tt Xi}, is used (no issue if the jacobian is constant or always defined with the same {\tt varf}, hazardous if it is with triplet array or if a full matrix is involved).
  \item[\texttt{structhess} :] Same as above but for the hessian function (unused if $f$ is P2 or less and constraints are affine). Here again, keep in mind that it is the hessian of the lagrangian function (which is equal to the hessian of $f$ only if constraints are affine). If no structure is given with this parameter, the lagrangian hessian is evaluated on the starting point, with $\sigma=1$ and $\lambda = (1,1,\dots,1)$ (it is safe if all the constraints and fitness function hessians are constant or build with {\tt varf}, and here again less reliable if built with triplet array or full matrix).
  \item[\texttt{checkindex} :] A {\tt bool} that triggers an index dichotomic search when matrices are copied from FreeFem functions to IPOPT arrays.  It is used to avoid wrong index matching when some null coefficients are removed from the matrices by FreeFem. It will not solve the problems arising when a too small structure has been given at the initialization of the algorithm. Enabled by default (except in cases where all matrices are obviously constant).
  \item[\texttt{warmstart} :] If set to {\tt true}, the constraints dual variables $\lambda$, and simple bounds dual variables are initialized with the values of the arrays passed to {\tt lm}, {\tt lz} and {\tt uz} named parameters (see below).
  \item[\texttt{lm} :]  {\tt real[int]} of size $m$, which is used  to get the final values of the constraints dual variables $\lambda$ and/or initialize them in case of a warm start (the passed array is also updated to the last dual variables values at the end of the algorithm).
  \item[\texttt{lz}, \texttt{uz} :] {\tt real[int]} of size $n$ to get the final values and/or initialize (in case of warm start) the dual variables associated to simple bounds.
  \item[\texttt{tol} :] {\tt real}, convergence tolerance for the algorithm, the default value is $10^{-8}$.
  \item[\texttt{maxiter} :] {\tt int}, maximum number of iterations with 3000 as default value.
  \item[\texttt{maxcputime} :] {\tt real} value, maximum runtime duration. Default is $10^{6}$ (almost 11 days and a half).
  \item[\texttt{bfgs} :] {\tt bool} enabling or not the (low-storage) BFGS approximation of the lagrangian hessian. It is set to false by default, unless there is no way to compute the hessian with the functions that have been passed to IPOPT.
  \item[\texttt{derivativetest} :] Used to perform a comparison of the derivatives given to IPOPT with finite differences computation. The possible {\tt string} values are : {\tt "none"} (default), {\tt "first-order"}, {\tt "second-order"} and {\tt "only-second-order"}. The associated derivative error tolerance can be changed via the option file. One should not care about any error given by it before having tried, and failed, to perform a first optimization.
  \item[\texttt{dth} : ] Perturbation parameter for the derivative test computations with finite differences. Set by default to $10^{-8}$.
  \item[\texttt{dttol} :] Tolerance value for the derivative test error detection (default value unknown yet, maybe $10^{-5}$).
  \item[\texttt{optfile} :] {\tt string} parameter to specify the IPOPT option file name. IPOPT will look for a {\tt ipopt.opt} file by default. Options set in the file will overwrite those defined in the FreeFem script.
  \item[\texttt{printlevel} :] An {\tt int} to control IPOPT output print level, set to 5 by default, the possible values are from 0 to 12. A description of the output informations is available in the \href{https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt/browser/stable/3.10/Ipopt/doc/documentation.pdf?format=raw}{pdf documentation} of IPOPT.
  \item[\texttt{fixedvar} :] {\tt string} for the definition of simple bounds equality constraints treatment : use {\tt "make\_parameter"} (default value) to simply remove them from the optimization process (the functions will always be evaluated with the fixed value for those variables), {\tt "make\_constraint"} to treat them as any other constraint or {\tt "relax\_bounds"} to relax fixing bound constraints.
  \item[\texttt{mustrategy} :] a {\tt string} to choose the update strategy for the barrier parameter $\mu$. The two possible tags are {\tt "monotone"}, to use the monotone (Fiacco-McCormick) strategy, or {\tt "adaptive"} (default setting).
  \item[\texttt{muinit} :] {\tt real} positive value for the barrier parameter initialization. It is only relevant when {\tt mustrategy} has been set to {\tt monotone}.
  \item[\texttt{pivtol} :] {\tt real} value to set the pivot tolerance for the linear solver. A smaller number pivots for sparsity, a larger number pivots for stability. The value has to be in the $[0,1]$ interval and is set to $10^{-6}$  by default.
  \item[\texttt{brf} :] Bounds relax factor : before starting the optimization, the bounds given by the user are relaxed. This option sets the factor for this relaxation. If it is set to zero, then the bounds relaxation is disabled. This {\tt real} has to be positive and its default value is $10^{-8}$.
  \item[\texttt{objvalue} :] An identifier to a {\tt real} type variable to get the last value of the objective function (best value in case of succes).

\subsection{Some short examples using IPOPT}
\begin{example}[IpoptVI.edp]
A very simple example consisting in, given two functions $f $ and $g$ (defined on $\Omega\subset\R^{2}$),  minimizing $J(u) = \displaystyle{\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega} \vert\nabla u\vert^{2}  - \int_{\Omega}fu}\ $, with $u\leq g$ almost everywhere :
\bFF

  @real r=0.03,s=0.1; //some parameters for g
 @ func g = r - r/2*exp(-0.5*(@square(@x-0.5)+square(@y-0.5))/ @square(s));
//g is constant minus a gaussian

  @macro Grad(u) [@dx(u),@dy(u)]//the gradient operator
  @varf vP(u,v) = @int2d(Th)(Grad(u)'*Grad(v)) - @int2d(Th)(f*v);
\eFF
Here we build the matrix and second member associated to the functional to minimize once and for all. The {\tt [A,b]} syntax for the fitness function is then used to pass it to IPOPT.
\bFF
  @matrix A = vP(Vh,Vh,solver=CG);
  @real[@int] b = vP(0,Vh);
\eFF

We use simple bounds to impose the boundary condition $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$, as well as the $u\leq g$ condition.
\bFF
  Vh lb=-1.e19; //lower-unbounded in the interior

We define the space : 
$$V = \left\lbrace (v_{1},v_{2})\in H^{1}(\Omega)^{2} ; v_{1}\vert_{\partial\Omega}=g_{1}, v_{2}\vert_{\partial\Omega}=g_{2}, v_{1}\leq v_{2}\ \mathrm{a.e.}\ \right\rbrace$$
as well as the functional $J:H^{1}(\Omega)^{2}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$:
$$J(v_{1},v_{2}) = \displaystyle{\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}\vert\nabla v_{1}\vert^{2} - \int_{\Omega} f_{1}v_{1} +  \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}\vert\nabla v_{2}\vert^{2} - \int_{\Omega} f_{2}v_{2}}$$
The problem consists in finding (numerically) two functions $(u_{1},u_{2}) = \underset{(v_{1},v_{2})\in V}{\operatorname{argmin}} J(v_{1},v_{2}) $.

\subsection{3D constrained minimal surface with IPOPT}

\subsubsection{Area and volume expressions}
This example aimed at numerically solving some constrained minimal surface problems with the IPOPT algorithm. We restrain to $C^{k}$ ($k\geq 1$), closed, spherically parametrizable surfaces, i.e. surfaces $S$ such that :
$$ \exists \rho \in C^{k}([0,2\pi ]\times[0,\pi] ) \vert 
S = \left\lbrace 
X = \left(
\begin{array} {c}
 \rhotp \\
 0 \\
 0
\end{array}
\right)
, (\theta,\phi) \in [0,2\pi ]\times[0,\pi]
  \right\rbrace$$
Where the components are expressed in the spherical coordinate system. Let's call $\Omega$ the  $[0,2\pi ]\times[0,\pi]$ angular parameters set. In order to exclude self crossing and opened shapes, the following assumptions upon $\rho$ are made :
$$ \rho \geq 0\ \ \mathrm{and}\ \ \forall \phi, \rho(0,\phi) = \rho(2\pi,\phi)$$
For a given function $\rho$ the first fundamental form (the metric) of the defined surface has the following matrix representation :
\begin{equation}\label{msfff}
G = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c c}
	\rho^{2}\sin^{2}(\phi) + (\dtheta\rho)^{2} &\dtheta\rho\dphi\rho \\
	\dtheta\rho\dphi\rho & \rho^{2} + (\dphi\rho)^{2} \\
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
This metric is used to express the area of the surface. Let $g=\det(G)$, then we have :
\begin{equation}\label{msarea}
	\mathcal{A}(\rho) 
	= \MyInt{\Omega}{\left\| \dtheta X \wedge \dphi X \right\|}
	=\MyInt{\Omega}{\sqrt{g}}
	=\MyInt{\Omega}{\sqrt{ \rho^{2}(\dtheta\rho)^{2}  + \rho^{4}\sin^{2}(\phi) + \rho^{2}(\dphi\rho)^{2}\sin^{2}(\phi)}d\theta d\phi}
\end{equation}
The volume of the space enclosed within the shape is easier to express :
\begin{equation}\label{msvolume}
	\mathcal{V}(\rho)
	= \MyInt{\Omega}{\int_{0}^{\rhotp} r^{2}\sin(\phi)  dr d\theta d\phi}
	= \frac{1}{3}\MyInt{\Omega}{\rho^{3} \sin(\phi) d\theta d\phi}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Derivatives}
In order to use a newton based interior point optimization algorithm, one must be able to evaluate the derivatives of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ with respect to $rho$. Concerning the area we have the following result :
$$
	\forall v\in C^{1}(\Omega) \ , \ \langle d\mathcal{A}(\rho),v\rangle
	= \MyInt{\Omega}{\frac{1}{2} \frac{ d\bar{g}(\rho)(v)}{\sqrt{g}}d\theta d\phi   }
$$
Where $\bar{g}$ is the application mapping the $\tp \mapsto g(\theta,\phi)$ scalar field to $\rho$. This leads to the following expression, easy to transpose in a freefem script using :
\begin{equation}\label{msdarea}
	\begin{array}{r c l}
		\forall v\in C^{1}(\Omega) \ , \ \langle d\mathcal{A}(\rho),v\rangle &
		=  & \MyInt{\Omega}{  \left(2\rho^{3}\sin^{2}(\phi) + \rho(\dtheta\rho)^{2} + \rho(\dphi\rho)^{2}\sin^{2}(\phi) \right) v} \\
		& &  +\MyInt{\Omega}{\ \rho^{2}\dtheta\rho\dtheta v\ + \ \rho^{2}\dphi\rho\sin^{2}(\phi)\dphi v   }
	\end{array}
\end{equation}

With a similar approach, one can derive an expression for second order derivatives. Though comporting no specific difficulties, the detailed calculus are tedious, the result is that 
these derivatives can be write using a $3\times 3$ matrix $\bm{B}$ whose coefficients are expressed in term of $\rho$ and its derivatives with respect to $\theta$ and $\phi$, such that :
\begin{equation}\label{msd2area}
	\forall (w,v)\in C^{1}(\Omega)\ ,\  d^{2}\mathcal{A}(\rho)(w,v) = \MyInt{\Omega}
	{
		\left(\begin{array}{c c c} w & \dtheta w &  \dphi w \end{array}\right)
		\bm{B}
	}	\left( \begin{array}{c} v \\ \dtheta v \\ \dphi v \end{array} \right) d\theta d\phi
\end{equation}

Deriving the volume function derivatives is again an easier task. We immediately get the following expressions :
\begin{equation}\label{msdvolume}
	\begin{array}{r c l}
		\forall v\ ,\ \langle d\mathcal{V}(\rho),v\rangle & = & \MyInt{\Omega}{\rho^{2}\sin(\phi)v\ d\theta d\phi} \\
		\forall w,v\ , d^{2}\mathcal{V}(\rho)(w,v) & = & \MyInt{\Omega}{2\rho\sin(\phi)wv\ d\theta d\phi}
	\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{The problem and its script :}
The whole code is available in {\tt IpoptMinSurfVol.edp}. We propose to solve the following problem : 

\begin{example} 
Given a positive function $\rho_{\mathrm{object}}$ piecewise continuous, and a scalar $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{max}} > \mathcal{V}(\rho_{\mathrm{object}})$,
find $\rho_{0}$ such that :
$$
\rho_{0} = \underset{\rho\in C^{1}(\Omega)}{\operatorname{argmin}}\ \mathcal{A}(\rho)\ ,\ \mathrm{s.t.}\  \rho_{0}\geq\rho_{\mathrm{object}} \ \mathrm{and\ } \mathcal{V}(\rho_{0})\leq \mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{max}}
$$
\end{example}
If $\rho_{\mathrm{object}}$ is the spherical parametrization of the surface of a 3-dimensional object (domain) $\mathcal{O}$, it can be interpreted as finding the surface with minimal area enclosing the object with a given maximal volume.
If $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{max}}$ is close to $ \mathcal{V}(\rho_{\mathrm{object}})$, so should be $\rho_{0}$ and $\rho_{\mathrm{object}}$. With higher values of $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{max}}$, $\rho$ should 
be closer to the unconstrained minimal surface surrounding $\mathcal{O}$ which is obtained as soon as $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{max}} \geq \frac{4}{3}\pi \|\rho_{\mathrm{object}}\|_{\infty}^{3} $ (sufficient but not necessary).

It also could be interesting to solve the same problem with the constraint $\mathcal{V}(\rho_{0})\geq \mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{min}}$ which lead to a sphere when 
$\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{min}} \geq \frac{1}{6}\pi \mathrm{diam}(\mathcal{O})^{3} $ and move toward the solution of the unconstrained problem as $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{min}}$ decreases.

We start by meshing the domain $[0,2\pi ]\times\ [0,\pi ]$, then a periodic P1 finite elements space is defined.

@fespace Vh(Th,@P1,@periodic=[[2,y],[4,y]]);
Vh startshape=5; //initial shape
\eFF
We create some finite element functions whose underlying arrays will be used to store the values of dual variables associated to all the constraints in order to reinitialize the algorithm with
it in the case where we use mesh adaptation. Doing so, the algorithm will almost restart at the accuracy level it reached before mesh adaptation, thus saving many iterations.

Then, follows the mesh adaptation loop, and a rendering function, {\tt Plot3D},  using 3D mesh to display the shape it is passed with {\tt medit} (the {\tt movemesh23} procedure often crashes

Here are the functions related to the area computation and its shape derivative, according to equations \ref{msarea} and \ref{msdarea} :
\bFF
@func @real Area(@real[@int] &X)

  Vh rho2 = @square(rho);
  Vh rho4 = @square(rho2);

    alpha = 2.*rho2*rho*sin2 + rho*dxrho2 + rho*dyrho2*sin2;
  }
  @varf dSurface(u,v) = 
    @int2d(Th)(1./sqrtPsi*(alpha*v+rho2*@dx(rho)*@dx(v)+rho2*@dy(rho)*sin2*@dy(v)));
  @real[@int] grad = dSurface(0,Vh);
  @return grad;
}
\eFF
The function returning the hessian of the area for a given shape is a bit blurry, thus we won't show here all of equation \ref{msd2area} coefficients definition, they can be found in the {\tt edp} file. 
\bFF
@matrix hessianA; //The global matrix buffer

@func @matrix HessianArea(@real[@int] &X)

                    + 2*rho*@dy(rho)*sin2*@dy(w)*v + 2*rho*@dy(rho)*sin2*w*@dy(v)

     );//end of int2d and varf
  hessianA = d2Area(Vh,Vh);
  @return hessianA;
}
\eFF
And the volume related functions :
\bFF
@func @real Volume(@real[@int] &X)
{
  Vh rho;
  rho[]=X;
  Vh rho3=rho*rho*rho;
  @real res = 1./3.*@int2d(Th)(rho3*@sin(y));
  @return res;
}

@func @real[@int] GradVolume(@real@[int] &X)
{
  Vh rho;
  rho[]=X;
  @varf dVolume(u,v) = @int2d(Th)(rho*rho*@sin(y)*v);
  @real[@int] grad = dVolume(0,Vh);
  @return grad;
}

@matrix hessianV;//buffer
@func @matrix HessianVolume(@real[@int] &X)
{
  Vh rho;
  rho[]=X;
  @varf d2Volume(w,v) = @int2d(Th)(2*rho*@sin(y)*v*w);
  hessianV = d2Volume(Vh,Vh);
  @return hessianV;
}
\eFF
If we want to use the volume as a constraint function
we must wrap it and its derivatives in some FreeFem++ functions returning the appropriate types.
It is not done in the above functions in case where one wants to use it as fitness function.
The lagrangian hessian also have to be wrapped since the Volume is not linear with 
respect to $\rho$, it has some non-null second order derivatives.
\bFF
@func @real[@int] ipVolume(@real[@int] &X) {@real[@int] vol = [Volume(X)]; @return vol;}

@matrix mdV;//buffer
@func @matrix ipGradVolume(@real[@int] &X) 
{//transforms a vector into a sparse matrix
  @real[@int,@int] dvol(1,Vh.ndof);
  dvol(0,:)=GradVolume(X); 
  mdV=dvol; 
  @return mdV;
}

@matrix HLagrangian; //buffer
@func @matrix ipHessianLag(@real[@int] &X,@real objfact,@real[@int] &lambda)
{
  HLagrangian = objfact*HessianArea(X) + lambda[0]*HessianVolume(X);
  @return HLagrangian;
}
\eFF
The {\tt ipGradVolume} function could bring some troubles during the optimization process because the gradient vector is transformed in a sparse matrix, so any null coefficient
will be discarded. We are here obliged to give IPOPT the structure by hand and use the {\tt checkindex} named-parameter to avoid bad indexing during copies. 
This gradient is actually dense, there is no reason for some components to be constantly zero :
\bFF
//sparse structure of a dense vector
@int[@int] gvi(Vh.ndof),gvj=0:Vh.ndof-1;
gvi=0; //only one line
\eFF
These two arrays will be passed to IPOPT with {\tt structjacc=[gvi,gvj]}. The last remaining things are the bounds definition. The simple lower bounds 
must be equal to the components of the P1 projection of $\rho_{object}$. And we choose $\alpha\in [0,1]$ to set $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{max}}$ to 
$(1-\alpha) \mathcal{V}(\rho_{object}) + \alpha\frac{4}{3}\pi \|\rho_{\mathrm{object}}\|_{\infty}^{3}$ :
\bFF
@real e=0.1,r0=0.25,rr=2-r0;
@real E=1./(e*e),RR=1./(rr*rr);
//An indented disc
@func disc1 = @sqrt(1./(RR+(E-RR)*@cos(y)*@cos(y)))*(1+0.1*@cos(9*x));
//Almost a standard disc
@func disc2 = @sqrt(1./(RR+(E-RR)*@cos(x)*@cos(x)*sin2))  ;
Vh lb =  @max(disc1, disc2);//glue the object parts
@real Vobj = Volume(lb[]); //object volume
@real Vnvc = 4./3.*@pi*@pow(lb[].linfty,3);//V for no volume constraint
@real alpha=0.1;
Plot3D(lb[],"object_inside",0);
@real[@int] clb=0.,cub=[(1-alpha)*Vobj + alpha*Vnvc];
\eFF
Calling IPOPT :
\bFF
@IPOPT(Area,GradArea,ipHessianLag,
      ipVolume,ipGradVolume,rc[], //functions and starting point
      @ub=ub[],@lb=lb[],@clb=clb,@cub=cub, //simple bounds and volume bounds
      @checkindex=1,@structjacc=[gvi,gvj],//for safe matrices copies
      @maxiter=kkk<nadapt-1 ? 40:150,//accurate optim only for last mesh adaptation iteration
      @warmstart=kkk,@lm=lm,@uz=uz[],@lz=lz[], //warmstart handling
      @tol=0.00001);

Plot3D(rc[],"Shape_at_"+kkk,0); //displays current solution
\eFF
At last, before closing the mesh adaptation loop, we have to perform the said adaptation. The mesh is adaptated with respect to the $X=(\rho,0,0)$ (in spherical coordinates) vector field, not
directly with respect to $\rho$, otherwise the true curvature of the 3D-shape would not be well taken into account.
\bFF
@if(kkk<nadapt-1)
{
  @Th = @adaptmesh(Th,
         rc*@cos(x)*@sin(y),//X
         rc*@sin(x)*@sin(y),//Y
         rc*@cos(y),//Z
         @nbvx=50000,
         @periodic=[[2,y],[4,y]]); //keeps mesh peridicity
  @plot(Th);
  startshape = rc; //shape interpolation on the new mesh
  uz=uz;//dual variables interpolation
  lz=lz;
} //end if
} //en of mesh adaptation loop
\eFF
Here are some pictures of the resulting surfaces obtained for decreasing values of $\alpha$ (and a slightly more complicated object than two orthogonal discs). We get back the enclosed object when $\alpha=0$ :

\subsection{The nlOpt optimizers}
The {\tt ff-NLopt}  package provides a FreeFem interface to the free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization, thus easing the use of several different free optimization (constrained or not) routines available
online along with the PDE solver. All the algorithms are well documented in \cite{nlopt}, thus no exhaustive informations concerning their mathematical specificities will be found here and we will focus on 
the way they are called in a FreeFem script. One needing detailed informations about these algorithms should visit the said cite where a description of each of them is given, as well as many bibliographical links. 
Most of the gradient based algorithm of nlOpt uses a full matrix approximation of the hessian, so if you're planing to solve a large scale problem, our advise would be to use the IPOPT optimizer which definitely surpass them. Finally, an examples of use can be found in the {\tt examples++-load/} directory under the name {\tt VarIneq2.edp}

All the nlOpt features are called that way :

\bFF
  @load "ff-NLopt"
  ... //define J, u, and maybe grad(J), some constraints etc...
  @real min = nloptXXXXXX(J,u,   //unavoidable part
                         grad = <name of grad(J)> , //if needed
                         lb = //lower bounds array
                         ub= //upper bounds array
                         ...//   some optional arguments :
                            //constraints functions names,
                            //                 stopping criterions,
                            //     algo. specific parameters,
                            //                                           etc...
                         );
\eFF

{\tt XXXXXX} refers to the algorithm tag (not necessarily 6 characters long). {\tt u} is the starting position (a {\tt real[int]} type array) which will be overwritten by the algorithm, the value at the end being the found argmin. And as usual, {\tt J} is a function taking a {\tt real[int]} type array as argument and returning a {\tt real}. {\tt grad}, {\tt lb} and {\tt ub} are "half-optionnal" arguments, in the sense that they are obligatory for some routines but not all.

The possible optional named parameters are the following, note that they are not used by all algorithm s (some does not supports constraints, or a type of constraints, some are gradient-based and other are derivative free, etc...). One can refer to the table after the parameters description to check which are the named parameters supported by a specific algorithm. Using an unsupported parameter will not stop 
the compiler work and seldom breaks runtime, it will just be ignored. That said, when it is obvious you are missusing a routine, you will get a warning message at runtime (for exemple if you pass a gradient 
to a derivative free algorithm, or set the population of a non-genetic one, etc...). In the following description, $n$ stands for the dimension of the search space.\\ \\



\index{ffNLOpt}
\begin{description}

\item[\textbf{Half-optional parameters :}]
\begin{description}
    \item[ ]
    \item[\texttt{grad=}]  The name of the function which computes the gradient of the cost function (prototype should be {\tt real[int]} $\rightarrow$ {\tt real[int]}, both argument and result should have the size $n$). 
    This is needed as soon s a gradient-based method is involved, ignored if defined in a derivative free context. 
    \item[\texttt{lb}/\texttt{ub} =] Lower and upper bounds arrays ({\tt real[int]} type) of size $n$. Used to define the bounds within which the search variable is allowed to move. 
    Needed for some algorithms, optional or unsupported for others.
    \item[\texttt{subOpt} :] Only enabled for the Augmented Lagrangian and MLSL method who need a sub-optimizer in order to work. Just pass the tag of the desired local algorithm with a {\tt string}.
\end{description}

\item[\textbf{Constraints related parameters (optional - unused if not specified):}]
\begin{description}
  \item[ ]
  \item[\texttt{IConst}/\texttt{EConst} :] Allows to pass the name of a function implementing some inequality (resp. equality) constraints on the search space. The function type must be 
  {\tt real[int]} $\rightarrow$ {\tt real[int]} where the size of the returned array is equal to the number of constraints (of the same type - it means that all the constraints are computed in one vectorial function).
  In order to mix inequality and equality constraints in a same minimization attempt, two vectorial functions have to be defined and passed. See example \ref{varineqex} for more details about how these
  constraints have to be implemented.
  \item[\texttt{gradIConst}/\texttt{gradEConst} :] Use to provide the inequality (resp. equality) constraints gradient. These are {\tt real[int]} $\rightarrow$ {\tt real[int,int]} type functions. Assuming we have defined
  a constraint function (either inequality or equality) with $p$ constraints, the size of the matrix returned by its associated gradient must be $p\times n$ (the $i$-th line of the matrix is the gradient of the $i$-th
  constraint). It is needed in a gradient-based context as soon as an inequality or equality constraint function is passed to the optimizer and ignored in all other cases.
  \item[\texttt{tolIConst}/\texttt{tolEConst} :] Tolerance values for each constraint. This is an array of size equal to the number of inequality (resp. equality) constraints. Default value os set to $10^{-12}$
  for each constraint of any type.  
\end{description}

\item[\textbf{Stopping criteria :}]
\begin{description}
  \item[ ]
  \item[\texttt{stopFuncValue} :] Makes the algorithm end when the objective function reaches this {\tt real} value.
  \item[\texttt{stopRelXTol} :] Stops the algorithm when the relative moves in each direction of the search space is smaller than this {\tt real} value.
  \item[\texttt{stopAbsXTol} :] Stops the algorithm when the moves in each direction of the search space is smaller than the corresponding value in this {\tt real[int]} array.
  \item[\texttt{stopRelFTol} :] Stops the algorithm when the relative variation of the objective function is smaller than this {\tt real} value.
  \item[\texttt{stopAbsFTol} :] Stops the algorithm when the variation of the objective function is smaller than this {\tt real} value.
  \item[\texttt{stopMaxFEval} :] Stops the algorithm when the number of fitness evaluations reaches this {\tt integer} value.
  \item[\texttt{stopTime} :] Stops the algorithm when the otpimization time in second exceeds this {\tt real} value. This is not a strict maximum: the time may exceed it slightly, 
  depending upon the algorithm and on how slow your function evaluation is.
 \end{description}
 Note that when an AUGLAG or MLSL method is used, the meta-algorithm and the sub-algorithm may have different termination criteria. Thus, for algorithms of this kind, the following
 named parameters has been defined (just adding the SO prefix - for Sub-Optimizer) to set the ending condition of the sub-algorithm (the meta one uses the ones above) : {\tt SOStopFuncValue}, 
 {\tt SOStopRelXTol}, and so on... If these ones are not used, the sub-optimizer will use those of the master routine.
 
 \item[\textbf{Other named parameters :}]
 \begin{description}
   \item[ ]
   \item[\texttt{popSize} :] {\tt integer} used to change the size of the sample for stochastic search methods. Default value is a peculiar heuristic to the chosen algorithm.
   \item[\texttt{SOPopSize} :] Same as above, but when the stochastic search is passed to a meta-algorithm.
   \item[\texttt{nGradStored} :] The number ({\tt interger} type) of gradients to "remember" from previous optimization steps: increasing this increases the memory requirements but may speed convergence.
   It is set to a heuristic value by default. If used with AUGLAG or MLSL, it will only affect the given subsidiary algorithm.
 \end{description}

\end{description}

The following table sums up the main characteristics of each algorithm, providing the more important information about which features are supported by which algorithm and what are the unavoidable arguments 
they need. More details can be found in \cite{nlopt}.

%\begin{example}[VarIneq.edp]
%\label{varineqex}
%Let $\Omega$ be a domain of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, $f_{1}, f_{2}\in L^{2}(\Omega)$ and $g_{1}, g_{2} \in L^{2}(\partial\Omega)$ four given functions with $g_{1}\leq g_{2}$ almost everywhere.
%We define the space : 
%$$V = \left\lbrace (v_{1},v_{2})\in H^{1}(\Omega)^{2} ; v_{1}\vert_{\partial\Omega}=g_{1}, v_{2}\vert_{\partial\Omega}=g_{2}, v_{1}\leq v_{2}\ \mathrm{a.e.}\ \right\rbrace$$
%as well as the functional $J:H^{1}(\Omega)^{2}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$:
%$$J(v_{1},v_{2}) = \displaystyle{\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}\vert\nabla v_{1}\vert^{2} - \int_{\Omega} f_{1}v_{1} +  \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}\vert\nabla v_{2}\vert^{2} - \int_{\Omega} f_{2}v_{2}}$$
%The problem consists in finding (numerically) two functions $(u_{1},u_{2}) = \underset{(v_{1},v_{2})\in V}{\operatorname{argmin}} J(v_{1},v_{2}) $.
%
%This can be interpreted as finding $u_{1}, u_{2}$ as close as possible (in a certain sense) to the solutions of Laplace equation with respectively $f_{1}, f_{2}$ second members
% and $g_{1}, g_{2}$ Dirichlet boundary conditions with the $u_{1}\leq u_{2}$ almost everywhere constraint.
%\end{example}
%
%Here is the corresponding script to treat this variational inequality problem with one of the NLOpt algorithms. The whole script is in the \texttt{VarIneq2.edp}.

%  @fespace Vh(Th,P1);
%\eFF
%
%Instead of defining the $J$ functional with explicit integral on the domain, we will write it in quadratic/linear form, since the corresponding matrix and vector will not change
%along with the iterations and the FreeFem matrix-vector product is optimized, this method will significantly speed up the approximation of the solution.
%
%\bFF
%  @varf BVF(v,w) = @int2d(Th)(0.5*@dx(v)*@dx(w) + 0.5*@dy(v)*@dy(w)); //bilinear

%  @real[@int] b1 = LVF1(0,Vh) , b2 = LVF2(0,Vh); //and vectors

%Then follows a trick that we will use later to pass the boundary conditions as non-linear equality constraints (although these are of course linear ones, but this approach

%To be able to play with gradient-based algorithm, we must have a gradient ready :

%\eFF
%As we use P1 Lagrange finite elements, the $u_{1}\leq u_{2} $ constraint can be expressed directly upon the degree of freedom. In NLOpt, one constraint must have the form $f(X)\leq 0$.

%	    @return constraints; //u1i - u2i <= 0
%  }
%\eFF
%One also has to define a gradient for each constraint if a gradient search is to be used. Constraint gradient must be a function which returns a matrix. The $i$-th line of this matrix is the gradient of
%the $i$-th constraint with respect to the variables of the search space.

%As mentioned earlier, we also define a set of equality constraints and their derivatives in order to handle the boundary conditions.

%Now we fill an initial vector and start the algorithm :
%\bFF
%  @real[@int] start(2*Vh.ndof);
%  start(0:Vh.ndof-1) = 0.; //starting with u1=u2=0 is bad
%  start(Vh.ndof:2*Vh.ndof-1) = 0.01; //a small difference is needed
%  
%  @real mini = @nloptAUGLAG(J, start, @grad=dJ,
%                          @IConst=IneqC, @gradIConst=dIneqC,
%                          @EConst=BC, @gradEConst=dBC,
%                          @subOpt="LBFGS",

%                         );
%\eFF
%Here we wrap a BFGS algorithm (which only works with unconstraint problems) in the augmented lagrangian method for both equality and inequality constraints. Another legit choice would be to use
%SLSQP, the only gradient-based search of the package supporting these two kinds of constraints (note that the {\tt subOpt} parameter is gone ) :
%\bFF
%  @real mini = @nloptSLSQP(J, start, @grad=dJ,
%                          @IConst=IneqC, @gradIConst=dIneqC,
%                          @EConst=BC, @gradEConst=dBC,
%                          @stopMaxFEval=10000, @stopAbsFTol=starttol
%                         );
%\eFF
%One can also try to pass derivative free algorithms to AUGLAG and discard the gradients to see what happens, or directly one which handles the two kinds of constraints. Just check 
%the tag in the table. The true script also has a loop in which the algorithm is restarted after mesh adaptation, nothing was said about that to avoid complicating an already relatively long
%script comment.








\subsection{Optimization with MPI}
The only quick way to use the previously presented algorithms on a parallel architecture lies in parallelizing the used cost function (which is in most real life case, the expensive part of the algorithm).
 Somehow, we provide a parallel version of the CMA-ES algorithm. The parallelization principle is the trivial one of evolving/genetic algorithms : at each iteration the cost function has to be evaluated $N$ 
 times without any dependence at all, these $N$ calculus are then equally distributed to each processes. Calling the MPI version of CMA-ES is nearly the same as calling its sequential version (a 
 complete example of use can be found in the \texttt{cmaes-mpi-VarIneq.edp} file).:

\bFF
  @load "mpi-cmaes"
  ... //define J, u and all here
  @real min = cmaesMPI(J,u,stopTolFun=1e-6,stopMaxIter=3000);
  @cout << "minimal value is " << min << " for u = " << u << @endl;
\eFF

If the population size is not changed using the {\tt popsize} parameter, it will use the heuristic value slightly changed to be equal to the closest greater multiple of the size of the communicator used by 
the optimizer. 
The FreeFem {\tt mpicommworld} is used by default. The user can specify his own MPI communicator with the named parameter "{ \tt comm=}", see the MPI section of this manual for more informations about 
communicators in \texttt{FreeFem++}.

%%% \subsection{conjugate Gradient/GMRES}
%%%
%%%Suppose we want to solve  the Euler problem (here $x$ has nothing to do with the reserved variable for the first coordinate in \freefempp): find $ x\in \R^n $  such that

%%%\label{eqn:dJ=0}
%%%\nabla J(x) = \left(\frac{\p J}{\p x_i} (\vec{x})\right) = 0
%%%\end{equation}
%%%where $ J$ is a functional (to minimize  for example) from  $ \R^n$ to $ \R$.
%%%
%%%If the function is convex we can use the conjugate gradient to solve the problem,

%%%
%%% \ttCC{@real[@int] x(20);}

%%%We can omit parameters \texttt{precon, nbiter, eps}.
%%%Here $M$ is the preconditioner whose default is the identity matrix.

%%%This algorithm works with a normal multivariate distribution in the parameters

%%%to control the starting distribution, size of the sample generations etc... Named parameters
%%%for this are the following :
%%%\index{CMAES}
%%%\begin{description}
%%%
%%%    \item[\texttt{seed=}] Seed for random number generator  \index{CMAES!seed=}
%%%    ({\tt val} is an integer). No specified value will lead to a clock based seed initialization.
%%%    
%%%    \item[\texttt{initialStdDev=}] Value for the standard deviations of the initial covariance matrix \index{CMAES!initialStdDev=}
%%%    ({\tt val} is a real). If the value $\sigma$ is passed, the initial covariance matrix will be set to $\sigma I$. The 
%%%            expected initial distance between initial $X$ and the $argmin$
%%%            should be roughly initialStdDev. Default is $0.3$.
%%%    
%%%    \item[\texttt{initialStdDevs=}] Same as above except that the argument is an array allowing to set a value of the initial standard deviation
%%%    for each parameter. Entries differing by several orders of magnitude should be avoided (if it can't be, try rescaling the problem).
%%%    
%%%    \item[\texttt{stopTolFun=}]  Stops the algorithm if function values differences are smaller than the passed one, default is $10^{-12}$.
%%%    
%%%    \item[\texttt{stopTolFunHist=}]  Stops the algorithm if function value differences of the best values are smaller than the passed one, default is $0$ (unused).
%%%    
%%%    \item[\texttt{stopTolX=}]  Stopping criteria triggered if step sizes in the parameters space are 
%%%                 smaller than this real value, default is $0$.
%%%                 
%%%    \item[\texttt{stopTolXFactor=}]  Stopping criteria triggered when the standard deviation increases more than this value. The default value is $10^{3}$.
%%%       
%%%    \item[\texttt{stopMaxFunEval=}]  Stops the algorithm when {\tt stopMaxFunEval} function evaluations have been done. Set to $900(n+3)^{2}$ by default, where $n$ is the parameters space dimension .
%%%                 
%%%    \item[\texttt{stopMaxIter=}]  Integer stopping the search when {\tt stopMaxIter} generations has been sampled. Unused by default.
%%%    
%%%    \item[\texttt{popsize=}]  Integer value used to change the sample size. The default value is $4+ \lfloor 3\ln (n) \rfloor$, see \cite{hansen}
%%%    for more details. Increasing the population size usually improves the global search capabilities at the cost of an at most linear reduction of the convergence speed with respect to {\tt popsize}.
%%%    
%%%    \item[\texttt{paramFile=}] This {\tt string} type parameter allows the user to pass all the parameters using an extern file as in Hansen's original code. More parameters related to the CMA-ES algorithm 
%%%    can be changed with this file. A sample of it can be found in the {\tt examples++-load/ffCMAES/} folder under the name {\tt initials.par}. Note that the parameters passed to the CMAES function in the 
%%%    FreeFem script will be ignored if an input parameters file is given.
%%%

%%%\subsubsection{The nlOpt optimizers}
%%%The {\tt ff-NLopt}  package provides a FreeFem interface to the free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization, thus easing the use of several different free optimization (constrained or not) routines available
%%%online along with the PDE solver. All the algorithms are well documented in \cite{nlopt}, thus no exhaustive informations concerning their mathematical specificities will be found here and we will focus on 
%%%the way they are called in a FreeFem script. One needing detailed informations about these algorithms should visit the said cite where a description of each of them is given, as well as many bibliographical links.
%%%
%%%All the nlOpt features are called that way :
%%%
%%%\bFF
%%%  @load "ff-NLopt"
%%%  ... //define J, u, and maybe grad(J), some constraints etc...
%%%  @real min = nloptXXXXXX(J,u,   //unavoidable part
%%%                         grad = <name of grad(J)> , //if needed
%%%                         lb = //lower bounds array
%%%                         ub= //upper bounds array
%%%                         ...//   some optional arguments :
%%%                            //constraints functions names,
%%%                            //                 stopping criterions,
%%%                            //     algo. specific parameters,
%%%                            //                                           etc...
%%%                         );
%%%\eFF
%%%
%%%{\tt XXXXXX} refers to the algorithm tag (not necessarily 6 characters long). {\tt u} is the starting position (a {\tt real[int]} type array) which will be overwritten by the algorithm, the value at the end being the found argmin. And as usual, {\tt J} is a function taking a {\tt real[int]} type array as argument and returning a {\tt real}. {\tt grad}, {\tt lb} and {\tt ub} are "half-optionnal" arguments, in the sense that they are obligatory for some routines but not all.
%%%
%%%The possible optional named parameters are the following, note that they are not used by all algorithm s (some does not supports constraints, or a type of constraints, some are gradient-based and other are derivative free, etc...). One can refer to the table after the parameters description to check which are the named parameters supported by a specific algorithm. Using an unsupported parameter will not stop 
%%%the compiler work and seldom breaks runtime, it will just be ignored. That said, when it is obvious you are missusing a routine, you will get a warning message at runtime (for exemple if you pass a gradient 
%%%to a derivative free algorithm, or set the population of a non-genetic one, etc...). In the following description, $n$ stands for the dimension of the search space.\\ \\

%%%\begin{description}
%%%
%%%\item[\textbf{Half-optional parameters :}]
%%%\begin{description}
%%%    \item[ ]
%%%    \item[\texttt{grad=}]  The name of the function which computes the gradient of the cost function (prototype should be {\tt real[int]} $\rightarrow$ {\tt real[int]}, both argument and result should have the size $n$). 
%%%    This is needed as soon s a gradient-based method is involved, ignored if defined in a derivative free context.

%%%    Needed for some algorithms, optional or unsupported for others.
%%%    \item[\texttt{subOpt} :] Only enabled for the Augmented Lagrangian and MLSL method who need a sub-optimizer in order to work. Just pass the tag of the desired local algorithm with a {\tt string}.

%%%\begin{description}
%%%  \item[ ]

%%%\begin{example}[VarIneq.edp]
%%%\label{varineqex}
%%%Let $\Omega$ be a domain of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, $f_{1}, f_{2}\in L^{2}(\Omega)$ and $g_{1}, g_{2} \in L^{2}(\partial\Omega)$ four given functions with $g_{1}\leq g_{2}$ almost everywhere.
%%%We define the space : 
%%%$$V = \left\lbrace (v_{1},v_{2})\in H^{1}(\Omega)^{2} ; v_{1}\vert_{\partial\Omega}=g_{1}, v_{2}\vert_{\partial\Omega}=g_{2}, v_{1}\leq v_{2}\ \mathrm{a.e.}\ \right\rbrace$$
%%%as well as the functional $J:H^{1}(\Omega)^{2}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$:
%%%$$J(v_{1},v_{2}) = \displaystyle{\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}\vert\nabla v_{1}\vert^{2} - \int_{\Omega} f_{1}v_{1} +  \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}\vert\nabla v_{2}\vert^{2} - \int_{\Omega} f_{1}v_{2}}$$
%%%The problem consists in finding (numerically) two functions $(u_{1},u_{2}) = \underset{(v_{1},v_{2})\in V}{\operatorname{argmin}} J(v_{1},v_{2}) $.
%%%
%%%This can be interpreted as finding $u_{1}, u_{2}$ as close as possible (in a certain sense) to the solutions of Laplace equation with respectively $f_{1}, f_{2}$ second members
%%% and $g_{1}, g_{2}$ Dirichlet boundary conditions with the $u_{1}\leq u_{2}$ almost everywhere constraint.
%%%\end{example}
%%%
%%%Here is the corresponding script to treat this variational inequality problem with one of the NLOpt algorithms. The whole script is in the \texttt{VarIneq2.edp}.

%%%\eFF
%%%
%%%Instead of defining the $J$ functional with explicit integral on the domain, we will write it in quadratic/linear form, since the corresponding matrix and vector will not change
%%%along with the iterations and the FreeFem matrix-vector product is optimized, this method will significantly speed up the approximation of the solution.

%%%\eFF
%%%One can also try to pass derivative free algorithms to AUGLAG and discard the gradients to see what happens, or directly one which handles the two kinds of constraints. Just check

%%%\subsubsection{Optimization with MPI}
%%%The only quick way to use the previously presented algorithms on a parallel architecture lies in parallelizing the used cost function (which is in most real life case, the expensive part of the algorithm).
%%% Somehow, we provide a parallel version of the CMA-ES algorithm. The parallelization principle is the trivial one of evolving/genetic algorithms : at each iteration the cost function has to be evaluated $N$ 
%%% times without any dependence at all, these $N$ calculus are then equally distributed to each processes. Calling the MPI version of CMA-ES is nearly the same as calling its sequential version (a 
%%% complete example of use can be found in the \texttt{cmaes-mpi-VarIneq.edp} file).:
%%%
%%%\bFF
%%%  @load "mpi-cmaes"
%%%  ... //define J, u and all here
%%%  @real min = cmaesMPI(J,u,stopTolFun=1e-6,stopMaxIter=3000);
%%%  @cout << "minimal value is " << min << " for u = " << u << @endl;
%%%\eFF
%%%
%%%If the population size is not changed using the {\tt popsize} parameter, it will use the heuristic value slightly changed to be equal to the closest greater multiple of the size of the communicator used by 
%%%the optimizer. 
%%%The FreeFem {\tt mpicommworld} is used by default. The user can specify his own MPI communicator with the named parameter "{ \tt comm=}", see the MPI section of this manual for more informations about 
%%%communicators in \texttt{FreeFem++}.

\section{Mathematical Models}
\label{sec:MathModels}
\paragraph{Summary}\emph{This chapter goes deeper into a number of problems that \freefempp can solve.  It is a complement to
chapter 3 which was only an introduction.  Users are invited to contribute to make this data base
of problems grow.}

\subsection{Static Problems}

\subsubsection{\setS{Soap Film}}
Our starting point here will be the mathematical model to find the shape of
\textbf{soap film} which is glued to the ring on the $xy-$plane
\begin{equation*}
C=\{(x,y);\;x=\cos t,\,y=\sin t,\,0\leq t\leq 2\pi \}.
\end{equation*}
We assume the shape of the film is described by the graph $(x,y,u(x,y))$ of the vertical
displacement $u(x,y)\, (x^2+y^2<1)$ under a vertical pressure $p$
in terms of force per unit area and an initial tension $\mu$ in terms of force
per unit length.
\\\\
Consider  the ``small plane'' ABCD, A:$(x,y,u(x,y))$, B:$(x,y,u(x+\delta x,y))$, C:$(x,y,u(x+\delta x,y+\delta y))$ and D:$(x,y,u(x,y+\delta y))$.
Denote by $\vec{n}(x,y)=(n_x(x,y),n_y(x,y),n_z(x,y))$ the normal vector of the surface $z=u(x,y)$.
We see that the vertical force due to the tension $\mu$ acting along the edge
AD is $-\mu n_x(x,y)\delta y$ and the the vertical force acting along the edge
AD is
\[
\mu n_x(x+\delta x,y)\delta y\simeq \mu\left(n_x(x,y)
+\frac{\p n_x}{\p x}\delta x\right)(x,y)\delta y.
\]
\begin{figure}[htbp]
%\label{fig:soupfilm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=3cm]{soapfilm}
\end{center}
%\caption{``small plane'' ABCD}
%\label{fig:soapfilm}
\end{figure}
Similarly, for the edges AB and DC we have
\[
-\mu n_y(x,y)\delta x,\qquad
\mu\left(n_y(x,y)+\p n_y/\p y\right)(x,y)\delta x.
\]
The force in the vertical direction on the surface ABCD due to the tension $\mu$ is given by
\[
\mu\left(\p n_x/\p x\right)\delta x\delta y+T\left(\p n_y/\p y\right)\delta y\delta x.
\]
Assuming small displacements, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\nu_x&=&(\p u/\p x)/\sqrt{1+(\p u/\p x)^2+(\p u/\p y)^2}\simeq \p u/\p x,\\
\nu_y&=&(\p u/\p y)/\sqrt{1+(\p u/\p x)^2+(\p u/\p y)^2}\simeq \p u/\p y.
\end{eqnarray*}
Letting $\delta x\to dx,\, \delta y\to dy$, we have the equilibrium of the vertical displacement of soap film on ABCD by $p$
\[
\mu dx dy\p^2 u/\p x^2 +  \mu dx dy\p^2 u/\p y^2
+ p dx dy = 0.
\]
Using the Laplace operator $\Delta = \p^2 /\p x^2 + \p^2 /\p y^2$, we can find the virtual displacement write the following
\begin{equation}
-\Delta u = f\quad \mbox{in }\Omega
\end{equation}%
where $f=p/\mu$, $\Omega =\{(x,y);\;x^{2}+y^{2}<1\}$.
 Poisson's equation (\ref{eqn:Poisson}) appears
also in \textbf{electrostatics} taking the form of $f=\rho /\epsilon $ where
$\rho $ is the charge density, $\epsilon $ the dielectric constant and $u$
is named as electrostatic potential. The soap film is glued to the ring $%
\p \Omega =C$, then we have the boundary condition
\begin{equation}
u=0\quad \mbox{on }\p \Omega
\end{equation}%
If the force is gravity, for simplify, we assume that $f=-1$.

In 19th line, the $L^2$-error estimation between the exact solution $u_e$,
$$
\|u_h - u_e\|_{0,\Omega}=\left(\int_{\Omega}|u_h-u_e|^2\, \d x\d y\right)^{1/2}
$$
and from 20th line to 21th line, the $H^1$-error seminorm estimation
$$
|u_h - u_e|_{1,\Omega}=\left(\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u_h-\nabla u_e|^2\, \d x\d y\right)^{1/2}
$$
are done on the initial mesh. The results are
$\|u_h - u_e\|_{0,\Omega}=0.000384045,\, |u_h - u_e|_{1,\Omega}=0.0375506$.

After the adaptation, we hava
$\|u_h - u_e\|_{0,\Omega}=0.000109043,\, |u_h - u_e|_{1,\Omega}=0.0188411$.
So the numerical solution is improved by adaptation of mesh.


\subsubsection{Electrostatics}
We assume that there is no current and a time independent charge distribution.
Then the electric field $\vec E$ satisfies
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:Maxwell0}
\mathrm{div}\vec E=\rho/\epsilon,\quad \mathrm{curl}\vec E=0
\end{eqnarray}
where $\rho$ is the charge density and $\epsilon$ is called the permittivity of free space. From the second equation in (\ref{eqn:Maxwell0}), we can introduce
the electrostatic potential such that $\vec E=-\nabla \phi$.
Then we have Poisson's equation $-\Delta \phi=f$, $f=-\rho/\epsilon$.
We now obtain the equipotential line which is the level curve of $\phi$,
when there are no charges except conductors $\{C_i\}_{1,\cdots,K}$.
Let us assume $K$ conductors $C_1,\cdots,C_K$ within an enclosure $C_0$.
Each one is held
at an electrostatic potential $\varphi_i$. We assume that the enclosure $C0$ is
held at
potential 0.
In order to know $\varphi(x)$ at any point $x$ of the domain $\Omega$, we must
solve
\begin{equation}
-\Delta \varphi =0\quad \textrm{in  }\Omega ,
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the interior of $C_0$ minus the conductors $C_i$, and
$\Gamma$ is the boundary of $\Omega$, that is $\sum_{i=0}^N C_i$.
Here $g$ is any function of $x$ equal to $\varphi_i$ on $C_i$ and to
0 on $C_0$. The boundary equation is a reduced form for:
\begin{equation}
\varphi =\varphi _{i}\;\text{on }C_{i},\;i=1...N,\varphi =0\;\text{on\ }%
C_{0}.
\end{equation}
\begin{example}~
First we give the geometrical informations; $C_0=\{(x,y);\; x^2+y^2=5^2\}$,
$C_1=\{(x,y):\; \frac{1}{0.3^2}(x-2)^2+\frac{1}{3^2}y^2=1\}$,
$C_2=\{(x,y):\; \frac{1}{0.3^2}(x+2)^2+\frac{1}{3^2}y^2=1\}$.
Let $\Omega$ be the disk enclosed by $C_0$ with the elliptical holes enclosed
by $C_1$ and $C_2$. Note that $C_0$ is described counterclockwise, whereas the
elliptical holes are described clockwise, because the boundary must be oriented so that the computational domain is to its left.

\subsubsection{Aerodynamics}
Let us consider a wing profile $S$ in a uniform flow.
Infinity will be represented
by a large circle $\Gamma_{\infty}$.
As previously, we must solve
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:NACA-5-5}
\Delta \varphi=0\quad\textrm{in }\Omega,
\quad \varphi|_S=c,\quad
\varphi|_{\Gamma_{\infty}}=u_{\infty 1x}-u_{\infty2x}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the area occupied by the
fluid, $u_{\infty}$ is the air speed at infinity, $c$
is a constant to be determined so that
$\p_n\varphi$ is continuous at the trailing edge
$P$ of $S$ (so-called Kutta-Joukowski condition).
Lift is proportional to $c$.
To find $c$ we use a superposition method. As all equations in
(\ref{eqn:NACA-5-5}) are
linear, the solution $\varphi_c$ is a linear function of $c$
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:NACA-5-6}
\varphi_c = \varphi_0 + c\varphi_1,
\end{equation}
where $\varphi_0$ is a solution of (\ref{eqn:NACA-5-5}) with $c = 0$ and
$\varphi_1$ is a solution with $c = 1$ and
zero speed at infinity.
With these two fields computed, we shall determine $c$
by requiring the continuity of $\p \varphi /\p n$ at the trailing edge.
An equation for the upper surface of a NACA0012 (this is a classical wing
profile in aerodynamics; the rear of the wing is called the trailing edge) is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:NACA-5-7} y = 0.17735\sqrt{x} - 0.075597x - 0.212836x^2 +
0.17363x^3 - 0.06254x^4.
\end{equation}
Taking an incidence angle $\alpha$ such that $\tan \alpha = 0.1$, we must solve
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:NACA-5-8}
-\Delta\varphi  = 0\qquad \textrm{in }\Omega, \qquad
\varphi|_{\Gamma_1} = y - 0.1x,\quad \varphi |_{\Gamma_2} = c,
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_2$ is the wing profile and $\Gamma_1$ is an approximation of
infinity. One finds $c$ by solving:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:NACA-5-9}
-\Delta\varphi_0 = 0 ~~\textrm{in }\Omega,\qquad
\varphi_0|_{\Gamma_1} = y - 0.1x, \quad \varphi_0|_{\Gamma_2} = 0,\\
\label{eqn:NACA-5-10}
-\Delta\varphi_1 = 0 ~~\textrm{in }\Omega, \qquad
\varphi_1|_{\Gamma_1} = 0, \quad \varphi_1|_{\Gamma_2} = 1.
\end{eqnarray}
The solution $\varphi  = \varphi_0+c\varphi_1$ allows us to find $c$
by writing that $\p_n\varphi$  has no jump
at the trailing edge $P = (1, 0)$.
We have $\p n\varphi  -(\varphi (P^+)-\varphi (P))/\delta$ where $P^+$
is the point just above $P$ in the direction normal to the profile at a distance
$\delta$. Thus the jump of $\p_n\varphi$  is
$(\varphi_0|_{P^+} +c(\varphi_1|_{P^+} -1))+(\varphi_0|_{P^-} +c(\varphi_1|_{P^-} -1))$
divided by $\delta$ because the normal changes sign between the lower and upper
surfaces. Thus
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:NACA-5-11}
c = -\frac{\varphi_0|_{P^+} + \varphi_0|_{P^-}}
{(\varphi_1|_{P^+} + \varphi_1|_{P^-} - 2)} ,
\end{equation}
which can be programmed as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:NACA-5-12}
c = -\frac{\varphi_0(0.99, 0.01) + \varphi_0(0.99,-0.01)}
{(\varphi_1(0.99, 0.01) + \varphi_1(0.99,-0.01) - 2)} .
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Error estimation}
There are famous estimation between the numerical result $u_h$ and the
exact solution $u$ of the problem \ref{eqn:Poisson} and \ref{eqn:Dirichlet}:
If triangulations $\{\mathcal{T}_h\}_{h\downarrow 0}$ is regular
(see \refSec{Regular Triangulation}), then we have the estimates
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:H1err}
|\nabla u - \nabla u_h|_{0,\Omega}&\le& C_1h\\
\label{eqn:L2err}
\|u - u_h\|_{0,\Omega}&\le& C_2h^2
\end{eqnarray}
with constants $C_1,\, C_2$ independent of $h$,
if $u$ is in $H^2(\Omega)$. It is known that $u\in H^2(\Omega)$
if $\Omega$ is convex.

In this section we check (\ref{eqn:H1err}) and (\ref{eqn:L2err}).
We will pick up numericall error if we use the numerical derivative,
so we will use the following for (\ref{eqn:H1err}).
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u - \nabla u_h|^2\, \d x\d y
&=&\int_{\Omega}\nabla u\cdot \nabla(u - 2u_h)\, \d x\d y+
\int_{\Omega}\nabla u_h\cdot \nabla u_h\, \d x\d y\\
&=&\int_{\Omega}f(u-2u_h)\, \d x\d y+\int_{\Omega}fu_h\, \d x\d y
\end{eqnarray*}
The constants $C_1,\, C_2$ are depend on $\mathcal{T}_h$ and $f$,
so we will find them by \freefempp.
In general, we cannot get the solution $u$ as a elementary functions
(see Section \ref{sec:TwoVarFunctions}) even if spetical functions are added.
Instead of the exact solution, here we use the approximate solution $u_0$  in
$V_h(\mathcal{T}_h,P_2),\, h\sim 0$.

\begin{example}~
\bFF
 1 : @mesh Th0 = @square(100,100);
 2 : @fespace V0h(Th0,P2);
 3 : V0h u0,v0;

17 :    @fespace Vh(Th,P1);
18 :    @fespace Ph(Th,P0);
19 :    Ph h = hTriangle;  // get the size of all triangles
20 :    Vh u,v;
21 :    @solve Poisson(u,v) =
22 :         @int2d(Th)( dx(u)*dx(v) + dy(u)*dy(v) )     //  bilinear form
23 :         - @int2d(Th)( f*v )                          //  linear form
24 :         + @on(1,2,3,4,u=0) ;                // boundary condition
25 :    V0h uu = u;
26 :    errL2[i-1] = @sqrt( @int2d(Th0)((uu - u0)^2) )/h[].max^2;
27 :    errH1[i-1] = @sqrt( @int2d(Th0)( f*(u0-2*uu+uu) ) )/h[].max;
28 : }
29 : @cout << "C1 = " << errL2.max <<"("<<errL2.min<<")"<< endl;
30 : @cout << "C2 = " << errH1.max <<"("<<errH1.min<<")"<< endl;
\eFF
\end{example}
We can guess that $C_1=0.0179253(0.0173266)$ and
$C_2=0.0729566(0.0707543)$, where the numbers inside the parentheses
are minimum in calculation.

\subsubsection{Periodic Boundary Conditions }\index{periodic}\index{fespace!periodic=}
We now solve the Poisson equation
$$ -\Delta u= sin(x+\pi/4.)*cos(y+\pi/4.)$$ on
the square $]0,2\pi[^2$
under bi-periodic boundary condition
$u(0,y)=u(2\pi,y)$ for all $y$ and
$u(x,0)=u(x,2\pi)$ for all $x$.
These boundary conditions are achieved from the definition
of the periodic finite element space.

\subsubsection{Poisson Problems with mixed boundary condition}
Here we consider the Poisson equation with mixed boundary
conditons: For given functions $f$ and $g$, find $u$ such that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:mixBoundary}
-\Delta u &=& f\qquad \textrm{in }\Omega\nonumber\\
u&=&g\quad \textrm{on }\Gamma_D,\quad
\p u/\p n=0\quad \textrm{on }\Gamma_N
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Gamma_D$ is a part of the boundary $\Gamma$ and
$\Gamma_N=\Gamma\setminus \overline{\Gamma_D}$.
The solution $u$ has the singularity at the points
$\{\gamma_1,\gamma_2\}=\overline{\Gamma_D}\cap\overline{\Gamma_N}$.
When $\Omega=\{(x,y);\; -1<x<1,\, 0<y<1\}$,
$\Gamma_N=\{(x,y);\; -1\le x<0,\, y=0\}$,\,
$\Gamma_D=\p \Omega\setminus \Gamma_N$,
the singularity will appear at $\gamma_1=(0,0),\, \gamma_2(-1,0)$,
and $u$ has the expression
$$
u=K_iu_S + u_R,\, u_R\in H^2(\textrm{near }\gamma_i),\, i=1,2
$$
with a constants $K_i$.
Here $u_S = r_j^{1/2}\sin(\theta_j/2)$ by the local polar coordinate
$(r_j,\theta_j$ at $\gamma_j$ such that
$(r_1,\theta_1)=(r,\theta)$.
Instead of poler coordinate system $(r,\theta)$, we use that
$r=\ttCC{sqrt( x\^2+y\^2 )}$ and $\theta = \ttCC{atan2(y,x)}$
in \freefempp.

\begin{example} Assume that $f=-2\times 30(x^2+y^2)$ and
$g=u_e=10(x^2+y^2)^{1/4}\sin\left ([\tan^{-1}(y/x)]/2\right)
+30(x^2y^2)$, where $u_e$S is the exact solution.

From 24th line to 28th, adaptation of meshes are done using the
base of singular term.
In 42th line, \ttCC{H1e}=$\|u_e\|_{1,\Omega}$ is calculated.
In last 2 lines, the relative errors are calculated, that is,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\|u^0_h-u_e\|_{1,\Omega}/\ttCC{H1e}&=&0.120421\\
\|u^a_h-u_e\|_{1,\Omega}/\ttCC{H1e}&=&0.0150581
\end{eqnarray*}
where $u^0_h$ is the numerical solution in \ttCC{T0h} and
$u^a_h$ is \ttCC{u} in this program.
\end{example}


\subsubsection{Poisson with mixte finite element}

Here we consider the   Poisson equation with mixed boundary value
problems:
For given functions $f$ , $g_d$, $g_n$, find $p$ such that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:mixBoundary1}
-\Delta p &=& 1 \qquad \textrm{in }\Omega\nonumber\\
p&=&g_d\quad \textrm{on }\Gamma_D,\quad
\p p/\p n=g_n\quad \textrm{on }\Gamma_N
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Gamma_D$ is a part of the boundary $\Gamma$ and
$\Gamma_N=\Gamma\setminus \overline{\Gamma_D}$.

The mixte formulation is: find $p$ and $\mathbf{u}$ such that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:fmixte1}
\nabla p +  \mathbf{u}  &=& \mathbf{0} \qquad \textrm{in }\Omega\nonumber\\
\nabla. \mathbf{u} &=& f \qquad \textrm{in }\Omega\nonumber\\
p&=&g_d\quad \textrm{on }\Gamma_D,\quad
\p u. n= \mathbf{g}_n.n \quad \textrm{on }\Gamma_N
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{g}_n$ is a vector such that $\mathbf{g}_n.n = g_n$.

The variationnal formulation is,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:fmixte2}
  \forall \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{V}_0 ,  \quad  &\int_\Omega  p \nabla.v +  \mathbf{v} \mathbf{v}  &= \int_{\Gamma_d} g_d \mathbf{v}.n \nonumber\\
   \forall {q} \in  \mathbb{P}   \quad  &  \int_\Omega  q \nabla.u &= \int_\Omega  q f \nonumber\\
   & \p u. n &= \mathbf{g}_n.n \quad \textrm{on }\Gamma_N
\end{eqnarray}
where the functionnal space are:
$$\mathbb{P}= L^2(\Omega),\qquad \mathbb{V}= H(div)=\{ \mathbf{v} \in L^2(\Omega)^2, \nabla. \mathbf{v} \in  L^2(\Omega) \}$$
 and
$$\mathbb{V}_0 = \{  \mathbf{v}\in \mathbb{V} ; \quad  \mathbf{v}. n = 0 \quad \mathrm{on }\;\; \Gamma_N \}.$$

To write, the \freefempp example, we have just to choose the finites elements spaces.
here $\mathbb{V}$ space  is discretize  with Raviart-Thomas finite element  \texttt{RT0} and $\mathbb{P}$ is discretize by
constant  finite element \texttt{P0}.

\subsubsection{Metric Adaptation and residual error indicator}


We do metric mesh adaption and compute the classical
residual error indicator $\eta_{T}$ on the element $T$ for the Poisson problem.

\begin{example}[adaptindicatorP2.edp]~
\index{tutorial!adaptindicatorP2.edp}
First, we solve the same problem as in a previous example.

21 : /*************
\eFF
\index{jump}\index{intalledges}\index{square}\index{lenEdge}\index{hTriangle}%\index{area}
Now, the local  error indicator $\eta_{T}$ is:
\def\Th{\mathcal{T}_{h}}
\def\AK{\mathcal{E}_{K}}

$$\eta_{T} =\left(  h_{T}^{2} || f + \Delta u_{{h}} ||_{L^{2}(T)}^{2} +\sum_{e\in \AK} h_{e} \,||\, [ \frac{\p u_{h}}{\p n_{k}}] \,||^{2}_{L^{2}(e)} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
   $$
where $h_{T}$ is the longest's edge of  $T$, ${\cal E}_T$ is the set of $T$ edge not on
$\Gamma=\p \Omega$, $n_{T}$ is the  outside unit normal to $K$, $h_{e}$ is the length of edge $e$,
$[ g ]$ is the jump of the function $g$ across edge (left value minus right value).

Of course, we can use a variational form to compute $\eta_{T}^{2}$,
with test function constant function in each triangle.

If the method is correct, we expect to look the graphics by an almost constant function $\eta$ on your computer as in Fig. \ref{fig:rhoP2}.

\end{example}

\subsubsection{Adaptation using  residual error indicator}


In the previous example we compute the error indicator,  now
we use it, to adapt the mesh.


The new mesh size is  given by the following formulae:
$$h_{n+1}(x)= \frac{h_{n}(x)}{f_{n}(\eta_K(x))} $$
where $\eta_n(x)$ is the level of error at point $x$ given by the local
error indicator, $h_n$ is the previous ``mesh size'' field, and $f_n$ is a user
function define by
$f_n = min(3,max(1/3,\eta_n / \eta_n^* ))$
 where $ \eta_n^* =mean(\eta_n) c $, and $c$ is an user
 coefficient generally close to one.


\begin{example}[AdaptResidualErrorIndicator.edp]~

	/*  build  the new mesh */
	@Th=adaptmesh(Th,IsMetric=1,h,splitpbedge=1,nbvx=10000);

\subsection{Elasticity}

Consider an elastic plate with undeformed shape $\Omega\times ]-h,h[$
in $\R^3$, $\Omega\subset\R^2$.
By the deformation of the plate,
we assume that a point $P(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ moves to
${\cal P}(\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3)$.
The vector $\vec{u}=(u_1,u_2,u_3)=(\xi_1-x_1,\xi_2-x_2,\xi_3-x_3)$ is called the
\key{displacement vector}. 
By the deformation,
the line segment
$\overline{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}+\tau\Delta\mathbf{x}}$ moves approximately to
$\overline{\mathbf{x}+u(\mathbf{x}),\mathbf{x}+\tau\Delta\mathbf{x}
+u(\mathbf{x}+\tau\Delta\mathbf{x})}$ for small $\tau$,
where
$\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,x_3),\, \Delta\mathbf{x}
=(\Delta x_1,\Delta x_2,\Delta x_3)$.
We now calculate the ratio between two segments
\[
\eta(\tau)=\tau^{-1}|\Delta\mathbf{x}|^{-1}
\left(|u(\mathbf{x}+\tau\Delta\mathbf{x})
-u(\mathbf{x})+\tau\Delta\mathbf{x}|-\tau|\Delta\mathbf{x}|\right)
\]
then we have (see e.g. \cite[p.32]{Necas})
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{\tau\to 0}\eta(\tau)=(1+2e_{ij}\nu_i\nu_j)^{1/2}-1,
\quad 2e_{ij}=\frac{\p u_k}{\p x_i}\frac{\p u_k}{\p x_j}+\left(\frac{\p u_i}{\p x_j}+
\frac{\p u_j}{\p x_i}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\nu_i=\Delta x_i|\Delta\mathbf{x}|^{-1}$. If the deformation is
\emph{small}, then we may consider that
\[
(\p u_k/\p x_i)(\p u_k/\p x_i)\approx 0
\]
and the following is called \emph{small \key{strain tensor}}
\[
\varepsilon_{ij}(u)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\p u_i}{\p x_j}+
\frac{\p u_j}{\p x_i}\right)
\]
The tensor $e_{ij}$ is called \emph{finite strain tensor}.

Consider the small plane $\Delta \Pi(\mathbf{x})$
centered at $\mathbf{x}$ with the
unit normal direction $\vec n=(n_1,n_2,n_3)$, then the surface
on $\Delta \Pi(\mathbf{x})$ at $\mathbf{x}$ is
\[
(\sigma_{1j}(\mathbf{x})n_j, \sigma_{2j}(\mathbf{x})n_j, \sigma_{3j}(\mathbf{x})n_j)
\]
where $\sigma_{ij}(\mathbf{x})$ is called \key{stress tensor} at $\mathbf{x}$.
Hooke's law is the assumption of a linear relation between $\sigma_{ij}$
and $\varepsilon_{ij}$ such as
\[
\sigma_{ij}(\mathbf{x})=c_{ijkl}(\mathbf{x})\varepsilon_{ij}(\mathbf{x})
\]
with the symmetry $c_{ijkl}=c_{jikl}, c_{ijkl}=c_{ijlk}, c_{ijkl}=c_{klij}$.

If Hooke's tensor $c_{ijkl}(\mathbf{x})$ do not depend on the choice of
coordinate system, the material is called \key{isotropic} at $\mathbf{x}$.
If $c_{ijkl}$ is constant, the material is called \emph{homogeneous}.
In homogeneous isotropic case, there is \emph{Lam\'{e} constants}
$\lambda, \mu$ (see e.g. \cite[p.43]{Necas}) satisfying
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:isotropic}
\sigma_{ij}=\lambda\delta_{ij}\textrm{div}u+2\mu \varepsilon_{ij}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\delta_{ij}$ is Kronecker's delta.
We assume that
the elastic plate is fixed
on $\Gamma_D\times ]-h,h[,\, \Gamma_D\subset \p\Omega$.
If the body force $f=(f_1,f_2,f_3)$ is given in $\Omega\times]-h,h[$
and surface force $g$ is given in $\Gamma_N\times]-h,h[,
\Gamma_N=\p\Omega\setminus\overline{\Gamma_D}$,
then the equation of equilibrium is given as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:elasticity}
-\p_j \sigma_{ij}&=&f_i~~\textrm{in }\Omega\times ]-h,h[,\quad
i=1,2,3\\
\sigma_{ij}n_j&=&g_i~~\textrm{on }\Gamma_N\times ]-h,h[,\quad
u_i=0~~\textrm{on }\Gamma_D\times ]-h,h[,\quad i=1,2,3
\end{eqnarray}

We now explain the plain elasticity.
\begin{description}
\item[Plain strain:]
On the end of plate, the contact condition $u_3=0,\, g_3=$ is satisfied.
In this case, we can suppose that $f_3=g_3=u_3=0$ and
$\vec u(x_1,x_2,x_3)=\overline{u}(x_1,x_2)$ for all $-h<x_3<h$.
\item[Plain stress:]
The cylinder is assumed to be very thin and subjected to no load on the
ends $x_3=\pm h$, that is,
\[
\sigma_{3i}=0,\quad x_3=\pm h,\quad i~1,2,3
\]
The assumption leads that $\sigma_{3i}=0$ in $\Omega\times ]-h,h[$
and $\vec u(x_1,x_2,x_3)=\overline{u}(x_1,x_2)$ for all $-h<x_3<h$.
\item[Generalized plain stress:]
The cylinder is subjected to no load at $x_3=\pm h$.
Introducing the mean values with respect to thickness,
\[
\overline{u}_i(x_1,x_2)=\frac{1}{2h}
\int_{-h}^h u(x_1,x_2,x_3)dx_3
\]
and we derive $\overline{u}_3\equiv 0$. Similarly we define the mean
values $\overline{f},\overline{g}$ of the body force and surface force
as well as the mean values $\overline{\varepsilon}_{ij}$ and
$\overline{\sigma}_{ij}$ of the components of stress and strain, respectively.
\end{description}
In what follows we omit the overlines of
$\overline{u}, \overline{f},\overline{g}, \overline{\varepsilon}_{ij}$ and
$\overline{\varepsilon}_{ij}$.
Then we obtain similar equation of equilibrium given in (\ref{eqn:elasticity})
replacing $\Omega\times ]-h,h[$ with $\Omega$ and changing $i=1,2$.
In the case of plane stress,
$\sigma_{ij}=\lambda^* \delta_{ij}\textrm{div}u+2\mu\varepsilon_{ij},
\lambda^*=(2\lambda \mu)/(\lambda+\mu)$.

The equations of elasticity are naturally written in variational form
for the displacement vector $u(x)\in V$ as
\Blue{$$
\int_\Omega [2\mu\epsilon_{ij}(\vec u)\epsilon_{ij}(\vec v)
+\lambda \epsilon_{ii}(\vec{u})\epsilon_{jj}(\vec v)]
=\int_\Omega \vec f\cdot \vec v +\int_\Gamma \vec g\cdot \vec v,%\`{u}
\forall \vec v\in V
$$}
where $V$ is the linear closed subspace of $H^1(\Omega)^2$.

\begin{example}[Beam.edp]
\index{tutorial!beam.edp}
Consider  elastic plate with the undeformed rectangle shape

\subsubsection{Fracture Mechanics}
Consider the plate with the crack whose undeformed shape is
a curve $\Sigma$ with the two edges $\gamma_1,\, \gamma_2$.
We assume the stress tensor $\sigma_{ij}$ is the state of
plate stress regarding $(x,y)\in \Omega_{\Sigma}=\Omega\setminus \Sigma$.
Here $\Omega$ stands for the undeformed shape of elastic plate
without crack.
If the part $\Gamma_N$ of the boundary $\p\Omega$ is fixed
and a load ${\cal L}=(\vec f,\vec g)\in
L^2(\Omega)^2\times L^2(\Gamma_N)^2$  is given,
then the displacement $\vec u$ is the minimizer of the potential energy
functional
\[
{\cal E}(\vec v;{\cal L},\Omega_{\Sigma})
=\int_{\Omega_{\Sigma}}
\{w(x,\vec v)-\vec f\cdot \vec v\}
-\int_{\Gamma_N}\vec g\cdot \vec v\
\]
over the functional space $V(\Omega_{\Sigma})$,
\[
V(\Omega_{\Sigma})
=\left\{ \vec v\in H^1(\Omega_{\Sigma})^2;\;
\vec v=0\quad \hbox{\rm on }
\Gamma_D=\p\Omega\setminus\overline{\Gamma_N}\right\},
\]
where $w(x,\vec v)=\sigma_{ij}(\vec v)\varepsilon_{ij}(\vec v)/2$,
\[
\sigma_{ij}(\vec v)=C_{ijkl}(x)\varepsilon_{kl}(\vec v),\quad
\varepsilon_{ij}(\vec v)=(\p v_i/\p x_j+
\p v_j/\p x_i)/2,
\qquad (C_{ijkl}:\quad \hbox{\rm Hooke's tensor}).
\]
If the elasticity is homogeneous isotropic, then the
displacement $\vec u(x)$ is decomposed in an open neighborhood $U_k$
of $\gamma_k$ as in (see e.g. \cite{Ohtsuka})
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:SIF}
\vec u(x) =
\sum_{l=1}^2 K_l(\gamma_k) r_k^{1/2} S^C_{kl}(\theta_k)
+ \vec u_{k,R}(x)
\quad \mbox{for }x\in \Omega_{\Sigma}\cap U_k,\, k=1,2
\end{equation}
with $\vec u_{k,R} \in H^2(\Omega_\Sigma\cap U_k)^2$, where
$U_k,\, k=1,2$ are open neighborhoods of $\gamma_k$ such that
$\p L_1\cap U_1=\gamma_1,\, \p L_m\cap U_2=\gamma_2$,
and
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:SIF2}
 S^C_{k1}(\theta_k) & = & \frac 1 {4\mu} \frac 1 {(2\pi)^{1/2}}
    \left[ \begin{array}{c}
    [2\kappa-1]\cos(\theta_k/2)-\cos(3\theta_k/2)\\
    -[2\kappa+1]\sin(\theta_k/2)+\sin(3\theta_k/2)
    \end{array}\right],\\
 S^C_{k2}(\theta_k) & = & \frac 1 {4\mu} \frac 1 {(2\pi)^{1/2}}
    \left[ \begin{array}{c}
    -[2\kappa-1]\sin(\theta_k/2)+3\sin(3\theta_k/2)\\
    -[2\kappa+1]\cos(\theta_k/2)+\cos(3\theta_k/2)
    \end{array}\right]. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mu$ is the shear modulus of elasticity,
$\kappa=3-4\nu$ ($\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio) for
plane strain and $\kappa=\frac {3-\nu} {1+\nu}$ for plane stress.

The coefficients $K_1(\gamma_i)$ and $K_2(\gamma_i),$ which are important parameters in fracture mechanics,
are called stress intensity factors of the opening mode (mode I)
and the sliding mode (mode II), respectively.

For simplicity, we consider the following simple crack
\[
\Omega=\{(x,y):\; -1<x<1, -1<y<1\},\qquad
\Sigma=\{(x,y):\; -1\le x\le 0, y=0\}
\]
with only one crack tip $\gamma=(0,0)$.
Unfortunately, \freefempp cannot treat crack, so we use the modification
of the domain with U-shape channel (see Fig. \ref{U-shape})
with $d=0.0001$. The undeformed crack $\Sigma$ is approximated by
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Sigma_d&=&\{(x,y):\; -1\le x\le -10*d, -d\le y\le d\}\\
&&\cup\{(x,y):\; -10*d\le x\le 0, -d+0.1*x\le y\le d-0.1*x\}
\end{eqnarray*}
and $\Gamma_D=\ttCC{R}$ in Fig. \ref{U-shape}.
In this example, we use three technique:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Fast Finite Element Interpolator from the mesh \ttCC{Th}
to \ttCC{Zoom} for the scale-up of
near $\gamma$.
\item
After obtaining the displacement vector $\vec u=(u,v)$, we shall watch
the deformation of the crack near $\gamma$ as follows,
\bFF
mesh Plate = movemesh(Zoom,[x+u,y+v]);
plot(Plate);
\eFF
\item
Adaptivity is an important technique here, because a large singularity occurs at
$\gamma$
as shown in (\ref{eqn:SIF}).
\end{itemize}
The first example creates mode I deformation by the opposed surface force
on \ttCC{B} and \ttCC{T}
in the vertical direction of $\Sigma$, and
the displacement is fixed on \ttCC{R}.

In a laboratory, fracture engineers use
photoelasticity to make stress field visible, which
shows the principal stress difference
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_1-\sigma_2=\sqrt{(\sigma_{11}-\sigma_{22})^2+4\sigma_{12}^2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are the principal stresses.
In opening mode, the photoelasticity make symmetric pattern concentrated at
$\gamma$.

It is difficult to create mode II deformation by the opposed shear force
on \ttCC{B} and \ttCC{T} that is observed in a laboratory.
So we use the body shear force along $\Sigma$, that is, the $x$-component $f_1$
of the body force $\vec f$ is given by
\[
f_1(x,y)=H(y-0.001)*H(0.1-y)-H(-y-0.001)*H(y+0.1)
\]
where $H(t)=1$ if $t>0$; $= 0$ if $t<0$.

\subsection{Nonlinear Static Problems}
Here we propose to solve the following non-linear academic  problem of minimization
of a functional $$J(u) = \int_\Omega \frac{1}{2} f(|\nabla u|^2) - u*b $$
where $u$ is function of $H^1_0(\Omega)$
and $f$ defined by
$$
f(x) = a*x + x-ln(1+x), \quad f'(x) = a+\frac{x}{1+x}, \quad f''(x) =  \frac{1}{(1+x)^2}
$$

\subsubsection{Newton-Raphson algorithm}

Now, we solve the Euler problem $ \nabla J (u) = 0$
with Newton-Raphson algorithm, that is,
$$
u^{n+1} = u^n - ( \nabla^2 J (u^{n}))^{-1}*\nabla J(u^n)
$$

\subsection{Eigenvalue Problems}

This section depends on your installation of \texttt{FreeFem++}; you need to have compiled (see \texttt{README\_arpack}),
ARPACK.
This tools is available in \texttt{FreeFem++}  if the word ``eigenvalue'' appear in line ``Load:'', like:
\bFF
-- FreeFem++ v1.28 (date Thu Dec 26 10:56:34 CET 2002)
 file : LapEigenValue.edp
 Load: lg_fem lg_mesh @eigenvalue
\eFF
This tools is based on the \texttt{arpack++} \footnote{\url{http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/}}
the object-oriented version of ARPACK eigenvalue package \cite{arpack}.

The function EigenValue computes the generalized eigenvalue
of  $ A u = \lambda B u $ where sigma =$\sigma$ is the shift of the method.
The matrix  $ OP$ is defined with $ A - \sigma B $.
The return value is the number of converged eigenvalue (can be greater than the number of eigen value nev=)

\bFF
@int k=@EigenValue(OP,B,nev= , sigma= );
\eFF
where the matrix $OP=  A - \sigma B $ with a solver and boundary condition,
and the matrix $B$.


\begin{note}{Boundary condition and Eigenvalue Problems\label{note BC EV}}\label{pp BC EV}

 The locking (Dirichlet ) boundary condition is make with exact penalization
 so   we put 1e30=tgv  on the diagonal term of the locked degree of freedom (see equation  (\ref{eq tgv})).
  So take Dirichlet boundary condition just on $A$
  and not on  $B$.
  because we solve $ w=OP^-1*B*v$.

  If you put  locking  (Dirichlet )  boundary condition on $B$ matrix  (with key work \ttCC{@on})
you get small spurious modes $(10^{-30})$, due to boundary condition, but if you forget the locking boundary condition on $B$ matrix  (no  key work "on")
you get huge spurious $(10^{30})$  modes associated to these boundary conditons.
We compute only small mode, so we get the good  one in this case.

In the first example, we compute   the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the
 Dirichlet problem  on square $\Omega=]0,\pi[^2$.

The problem is to find:   $\lambda$, and $\nabla u_{\lambda}$  in $\mathbb{R}{\times} H^1_0(\Omega)$
$$ \int_\Omega \nabla u_{\lambda} \nabla v = \lambda \int_\Omega u  v \quad  \forall v \in H^1_0(\Omega)$$

The exact
eigenvalues are $\lambda_{n,m} =(n^2+m^2), (n,m)\in {\mathbb{N}_*}^2$ with
the associated eigenvectors are  $  u_{{m,n}}=sin(nx)*sin(my)$.



We use the generalized inverse shift mode of the \texttt{arpack++} library, to find
20 eigenvalues and eigenvectors close to the shift value $\sigma=20$.

\subsection{\setS{Evolution Problems}}
\freefempp also solves evolution problems such as the heat equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{prb:heat}
&&\frac{\p u}{\p t}-\mu\Delta u=f\quad \textrm{in }\Omega\times ]0,T[,\\
&&u(\vec x,0)=u_0(\vec x)\quad \textrm{in }\Omega; \qquad
\left(\p u/\p n\right)(\vec x,t)=0\quad\textrm{on }\p\Omega\times ]0,T[.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
with a positive viscosity coefficient $\mu$ and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
We solve (\ref{prb:heat}) by FEM in space and finite differences in time.
We use the definition of the partial derivative of the solution in the time
derivative,
\[
\frac{\p u}{\p t}(x,y,t) = \lim_{\tau \to 0}
\frac{u(x,y,t)-u(x,y,t-\tau )}{\tau }
\]
which indicates that $u^m(x,y)=u(x,y,m\tau )$ will satisfy approximatively
\[
\frac{\p u}{\p t}(x,y,m\tau )\simeq \frac{u^m(x,y)-u^{m-1}(x,y)}{\tau }
\]
The time discretization of heat equation (\ref{eqn:heat}) is as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:heat}
&&\frac{u^{m+1}-u^{m}}{\tau }-\mu\Delta u^{m+1}=f^{m+1}
\quad \textrm{in }\Omega\\
&&u^0(\vec x)=u_0(\vec x)\quad \textrm{in }\Omega; \qquad
\p u^{m+1}/\p n(\vec x)=0\quad\textrm{on }\p\Omega,\quad
\textrm{for all }m=0,\cdots,[T/\tau ],\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
which is so-called \key{backward Euler method} for (\ref{eqn:heat}).
To obtain the variational formulation, multiply with the test function $v$ both sides of the equation:
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\Omega }\{u^{m+1}v-\tau \Delta u^{m+1}v\}
=\int_{\Omega }\{u^m+\tau  f^{m+1}\}v\, .
\end{equation*}%
By the divergence theorem, we have
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\Omega} \{u^{m+1}v+\tau \nabla u^{m+1}\cdot \nabla v\}
-\int_{\p\Omega} \tau \left( \p u^{m+1}/\p n\right) v=\int_{\Omega }\{u^mv+\tau f^{m+1}v\}.
\end{equation*}%
By the boundary condition $\p u^{m+1}/\p n=0$, it follows that
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:BackEuler}
\int_{\Omega} \{u^{m+1}v+\tau \nabla u^{m+1}\cdot \nabla v\}-
\int_{\Omega }\{u^mv+\tau f^{m+1}v\}=0.
\end{equation}%
Using the identity just above, we can calculate the finite element
approximation $u_h^m$ of $u^m$ in a step-by-step manner with respect to $t$.

\begin{example}
We now solve the following example with the exact solution $u(x,y,t)=tx^4$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\frac{{\p u}}{{\p t}} - \mu \Delta u = x^4 - \mu 12tx^2 ~
\textrm{in  } \Omega  \times ]0,3[,\, \Omega = ]0,1[^2 \\
&&u(x,y,0) = 0\quad\textrm{on }\Omega,\qquad \left. u \right|_{\p\Omega}  = t*x^4
\end{eqnarray*}
\bFF
// heat equation  $\p_t u = -\mu \Delta u = x^4 - \mu 12tx^2$
@mesh Th=@square(16,16);
@fespace Vh(Th,P1);

Vh u,v,uu,f,g;
@real dt = 0.1, mu = 0.01;
@problem dHeat(u,v) =
    @int2d(Th)( u*v + dt*mu*(@dx(u)*@dx(v) + @dy(u)*@dy(v)))
    + @int2d(Th) (- uu*v - dt*f*v )
    + @on(1,2,3,4,u=g);

@real t = 0; // start from t=0
uu = 0;     // u(x,y,0)=0
@for (@int m=0;m<=3/dt;m++)
{
   t=t+dt;
   f = x^4-mu*t*12*x^2;
   g = t*x^4;
   dHeat;
   @plot(u,wait=true);
   uu = u;
   @cout <<"t="<<t<<"L^2-Error="<<@sqrt( @int2d(Th)((u-t*x^4)^2) ) << @endl;
}
\eFF
In the last statement, the $L^2$-error
$\left(\int_{\Omega}\left| u-tx^4\right|^2\right)^{1/2}$ is calculated at
$t=m\tau , \tau =0.1$. At $t=0.1$, the error is 0.000213269.
The errors increase with $m$ and 0.00628589 at $t=3$.

The iteration of the backward Euler (\ref{eqn:BackEuler}) is made by
\textbf{for loop} (see \refSec{Loops}).

\subsubsection{Mathematical Theory on Time Difference Approximations.}
In this section, we show the advantage of implicit schemes.
Let $V, H$ be separable Hilbert space and $V$ is dense in $H$.
Let $a$ be a continuous bilinear form over $V \times V$ with coercivity and
symmetry.
Then $\sqrt{a(v,v)}$ become equivalent to the norm $\| v\|$ of $V$.

\textbf{Problem  Ev$(f,\Omega)$}: For a given $f\in L^2(0,T;V'),\, u^0\in H$
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:Abstract}
\frac{d}{dt}(u(t),v)+a(u(t),v)&=&( f(t),v)\qquad \forall v\in V,,\quad a.e. \, t\in [0,T]\\
u(0)&=&u^0\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $V'$ is the dual space of $V$.
Then, there is an unique solution
$u\in L^{\infty}(0,T;H)\cap L^2(0,T;V)$.

Let us denote the time step by $\tau>0$, $N_T=[T/\tau]$.
For the discretization, we put $u^n = u(n\tau)$
and consider the time difference for each $\theta\in [0,1]$
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:t-method}
\frac{1}{\tau}\left( u_h^{n+1}-u_h^n,\phi_i\right)
+a\left( u_h^{n+\theta},\phi_i\right)=\langle f^{n+\theta},\phi_i\rangle\\
i=1,\cdots, m,\quad n=0,\cdots, N_T\nonumber\\
u_h^{n+\theta}=\theta u_h^{n+1}+(1-\theta)u_h^n,\quad
f^{n+\theta}=\theta f^{n+1}+(1-\theta)f^n\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Formula (\ref{eqn:t-method}) is the \emph{forward Euler scheme} if
$\theta=0$, \emph{Crank-Nicolson scheme} if $\theta=1/2$,
the \emph{backward Euler scheme} if $\theta=1$.

Unknown vectors $u^n=(u_h^1,\cdots,u_h^M)^T$ in
\[
u_h^n(x)=u^n_1\phi_1(x)+\cdots+u^n_m\phi_m(x),\quad u^n_1,\cdots,u^n_m\in \R
\]
are obtained from solving the matrix
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:Evolution-1}
(M+\theta\tau A)u^{n+1}=\{M-(1-\theta)\tau A\}u^n
+\tau\left\{\theta f^{n+1}+(1-\theta)f^n\right\}\\
M=(m_{ij}),\quad m_{ij}=(\phi_j,\phi_i),\qquad
A=(a_{ij}),\quad a_{ij}=a(\phi_j,\phi_i)\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Refer \cite[pp.70--75]{TA94} for solvability of (\ref{eqn:Evolution-1}).
The stability of (\ref{eqn:Evolution-1}) is in \cite[Theorem 2.13]{TA94}:
\begin{quotation}
Let $\{\mathcal{T}_h\}_{h\downarrow 0}$ be regular triangulations
(see \refSec{Regular Triangulation}).
Then there is a number $c_0>0$ independent of $h$ such that,
\begin{eqnarray}
|u_h^n|^2\le
\left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
\frac{1}{\delta}\left\{
|u^0_h|^2+\tau \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\|f^{k+\theta}\|^2_{V_h'}
\right\}&\theta\in [0,1/2)\\
|u^0_h|^2+\tau \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\|f^{k+\theta}\|^2_{V_h'}&\theta\in [1/2,1]
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray}
if the following are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item When $\theta\in [0,1/2)$, then we can take a time step $\tau$ in
such a way that
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau <\frac{2(1-\delta)}{(1-2\theta)c_0^2}h^2
\end{eqnarray}
for arbitrary $\delta\in (0,1)$.
  \item When $1/2\le \theta\le 1$, we can take $\tau$ arbitrary.

\subsubsection{Convection}
The hyperbolic equation
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:conv}
\p_t u +\vec{\alpha} \cdot \nabla u=f;~~ %% FH   pb sign 2008
\textrm{for a vector-valued function }\vec{\alpha},~
\end{eqnarray}
appears frequently in scientific problems, for example in the
Navier-Stokes equations, in the Convection-Diffusion equation, etc.

In the case of 1-dimensional space, we can easily find the general solution
$(x,t)\mapsto u(x,t)=u^0(x-\alpha t)$ of the following equation, if $\alpha$ is constant,
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:conv0}
\p_t u +\alpha\p_x u=0,\qquad u(x,0)=u^0(x),
\end{eqnarray}
because $\p_t u +\alpha\p_x u=-\alpha\dot{u}^0+a\dot{u}^0=0$,
where $\dot{u}^0=du^0(x)/dx$.
Even if $\alpha$ is not constant, the construction worsk on similar principles.
One begins with the ordinary differential equation
(with the convention that $\alpha$
is prolonged by zero apart from $(0,L)\times (0,T)$):
\[
\dot{X}(\tau )=+\alpha(X(\tau ),\tau ),~~~\tau \in (0,t)\quad X(t)=x%% FH   pb sign 2008
\]%
In this equation $\tau$ is the variable and $x,t$ are parameters,
and we denote the solution by $X_{x,t}(\tau )$.
Then it is noticed that $(x,t)\rightarrow v(X(\tau ),\tau )$ in
$\tau=t$ satisfies the equation
\[
\p _{t}v+\alpha\p _{x}v=\p _{t}X\dot{v}+a\p _{x}X\dot{v}%
=0
\]%
and by the definition $\p _{t}X=\dot{X}=+\alpha$ and %% FH   pb sign 2008
$\p_{x}X=\p _{x}x$ in $\tau=t$, because
if $\tau =t$ we have $X(\tau )=x$.
The general solution of (\ref{eqn:conv0}) is thus the value of the boundary condition in $X_{x, t}(0)$,
that is to say $u(x,t)=u^{0}(X_{x,t}(0))$ where $X_{x,t}(0)$ is on the
$x$ axis, $u(x,t)=u^{0}(X_{x,t}(0))$ if $X_{x,t}(0)$ is on the axis of
$t$.

In higher dimension $\Omega \subset R^{d},~d=2,3$, the equation for the
convection is written
\[
\p _{t}u+\vec{\alpha}\cdot \nabla u=0\hbox{ in }\Omega \times (0,T)
\]%
where  $\vec{a}(x,t)\in R^{d}$.
\freefempp implements the Characteristic-Galerkin method for convection operators. Recall that the equation (\ref{eqn:conv})
can be discretized as
\[
\frac{Du}{Dt} = f\;\;\textrm{i.e. }\frac{du}{dt}\left( {X(t),t} \right) = f\left(X( t ),t \right)\textrm{  where  }\frac{dX}{dt}( t ) = \vec \alpha( {X(t),t})
\]
where $D$  is  the total derivative operator.
So a good scheme is one step of backward
convection by the method of Characteristics-Galerkin
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:Charac}
\frac{1}{{\tau }}\left(u^{m + 1}(x) - u^m(X^m(x))\right) = f^m (x)
\end{eqnarray}
where $X^m (x)$ is an approximation of the solution at $t = m\tau $
of the ordinary differential equation
\[
\frac{d\vec{X}}{dt}(t) = \vec{\alpha}^m(\vec{X}(t)),\, \vec{X}((m + 1)\tau ) = x.
\]
where $\vec{\alpha}^m(x)=(\alpha_1(x,m\tau ),\alpha_2(x,m\tau ))$.
Because, by Taylor's expansion, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:conv1}
u^m(\vec {X}(m\tau ))&=&
u^m(\vec{X}((m+1)\tau )) -
\tau \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{\p u^m}{\p x_i}(\vec{X}((m+1)\tau ))
\frac{\p X_i}{\p t}((m+1)\tau )
+o(\tau )\nonumber\\
&=&u^m(x)-\tau \vec{\alpha}^m(x)\cdot \nabla u^m(x)+o(\tau )
\end{eqnarray}
where $X_i(t)$ are the i-th component of $\vec{X}(t)$,
$u^m(x)=u(x,m\tau )$
and we used the chain rule and $x=\vec{X}((m+1)\tau )$.
From (\ref{eqn:conv1}), it follows that
\begin{eqnarray}
u^m(X^m(x))=u^m(x)-\tau \vec{\alpha}^m(x)\cdot \nabla u^m(x)+o(\tau ).
\end{eqnarray}
Also we apply Taylor's expansion for
$t\mapsto u^m(x-\vec{\alpha}^m(x)t),\, 0\le t\le \tau $, then
\[
u^m(x-\vec{\alpha}\tau )=u^m(x)-\tau \vec{\alpha}^m(x)\cdot \nabla u^m(x)+o(\tau ).
\]
Putting
\[
\ttCC{@convect}\left( {\vec{\alpha},-\tau ,u^m } \right)
\approx u^m \left(x - \vec{\alpha}^m\tau  \right),%% FH 2008 sign
\]
we can get the approximation
\[
u^m \left( {X^m( x )} \right) \approx
{\ttCC{@convect}}\left( {[a_1^m ,a_2^m],-\tau ,u^m } \right)\;\;
\textrm{by }X^m \approx x \mapsto x- \tau [a_1^m(x) ,a_2^m(x)]  ).%% FH 2008 sign
\]

A classical convection problem is that of the ``rotating bell''
(quoted from \cite{Lucquin}[p.16]).
Let $\Omega$ be the unit disk centered at 0,
with its center rotating with speed
$\alpha_1 = y,\, \alpha_2 = -x$
We consider the problem (\ref{eqn:conv}) with $f=0$ and the initial condition
$u(x,0)=u^0(x)$, that is, from (\ref{eqn:Charac})
\begin{eqnarray*}
u^{m + 1}(x) = u^m(X^m(x))\approx \texttt{convect}(\vec{\alpha},-\tau ,u^m).%% FH 2008 sign
\end{eqnarray*}
The exact solution is $u(x, t) = u(\vec{X}(t))$
where $\vec{X}$ equals $x$
rotated around the origin by an angle $\theta = -t$ (rotate in clockwise).
So, if $u^0$ in a 3D perspective
looks like a bell, then $u$ will have exactly the same shape, but rotated by the
same amount.
The program consists in solving the equation until $T = 2\pi$, that is for a full
revolution and to compare the final solution with the initial one; they should
be equal.

\index{tutorial!convect.edp}
\bFF
@border C(t=0, 2*pi) { x=cos(t);  y=sin(t); }; // the unit circle
@mesh Th = @buildmesh(C(70));   // triangulates the disk

Vh u0 = @exp(-10*((x-0.3)^2 +(y-0.3)^2));    // give $u^0$

@real dt = 0.17,t=0;       // time step
Vh a1 = -y, a2 = x;                   // rotation velocity
Vh u; // $u^{m+1}$
@for (@int m=0; m<2*pi/dt ; m++) {
    t += dt;
    u=@convect([a1,a2],-dt,u0);  // $u^{m+1}=u^m(X^m(x))$
    u0=u;                      // m++
    @plot(u,cmm=" t="+t + ", min=" + u[].min + ", max=" +  u[].max,wait=0);
};

\end{example}
\begin{note}
The scheme \texttt{convect} is unconditionally stable, then
the bell become lower and lower (the maximum of $u^{37}$ is $0.406$ as shown in Fig. \ref{BellLast}).

which is to be integrated in $\left( {0,T} \right) \times \R^ +   \times \R^ +$
subject to, in the case of a put
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:BS-1-2}
u\left( {x , y ,T} \right) = \left( {K - \max \left( {x ,y } \right)} \right)^ +  .
\end{eqnarray}
Boundary conditions for this problem may not be so easy to device.
As in the one dimensional case the PDE contains boundary conditions on the axis
$x_1 = 0$ and on the axis $x_2 = 0$, namely two one dimensional Black-Scholes equations driven
respectively by the data $u\left( {0, + \infty ,T} \right)$
and $u\left( { + \infty ,0,T} \right)$.
These will be automatically accounted for because they are embedded in the PDE.
So if we do nothing in the variational form (i.e. if we take a Neumann boundary condition at
these two axis in the strong form) there will be no disturbance to these.
At infinity in one of the variable, as in 1D, it makes sense to impose $u=0$.
We take
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:BS-1-5}
\sigma _1  = 0.3,\;\;\sigma _2  = 0.3,\;\;\rho  = 0.3,\;\;r = 0.05,\;\;K = 40,\;\;T = 0.5
\end{eqnarray}
An implicit Euler scheme is used and a mesh adaptation is done every 10 time steps.
To have an unconditionally stable scheme, the first order terms are treated by the
Characteristic Galerkin method, which, roughly, approximates
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:BS-1-6}
\frac{{\p u}}{{\p t}} + a_1 \frac{{\p u}}{{\p x}} + a_2 \frac{{\p u}}{{\p y}} \approx \frac{1}{{\tau }}\left( {u^{n + 1} \left( x \right) - u^n \left( {x - \vec \alpha\tau } \right)} \right)
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Navier-Stokes Equation}

\subsubsection{Stokes and Navier-Stokes}

The Stokes equations are: for a given $\vec{f}\in L^2(\Omega)^2$,
\index{stokes}
\Blue{
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:Stokes}
    \left.\begin{array}{cl}
 -\Delta \vec{u}+\nabla p & =\vec{f} \\
 \nabla\cdot \vec{u} &=0
 \end{array}\right\}\quad \hbox{ in }\Omega
\end{equation}}
where $\vec{u}=(u_1,u_2)$ is the velocity vector and $p$ the pressure.
For simplicity, let us choose Dirichlet boundary conditions
on the velocity,  $\vec{u}=\vec{u}_{\Gamma}$ on $\Gamma$.

In Temam [Theorem 2.2], there ia a weak form of (\ref{eqn:Stokes}):
Find $\vec{v}=(v_1,v_2)\in \vec{V}(\Omega)$
\[
\vec{V}(\Omega)=\{\vec{w}\in H^1_0(\Omega)^2|\; \textrm{div}\vec{w}=0\}
\]
which satisfy
\[
\sum_{i=1}^2\int_{\Omega}\nabla u_i\cdot \nabla v_i=\int_{\Omega}\vec{f}\cdot \vec{w}
\quad \textrm{for all }v\in V
\]
Here it is used the existence
$p\in H^1(\Omega)$ such that $\vec{u}=\nabla p$, if
\[
\int_{\Omega}\vec{u}\cdot \vec{v}=0\quad \textrm{for all }\vec{v}\in
V
\]
\medskip

Another weak form is derived as follows: We put
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{V}=H^1_0(\Omega)^2;\quad
W=\left\{q\in L^2(\Omega)\left|\; \int_{\Omega}q=0\right.\right\}
\end{eqnarray*}
By multiplying the first equation in (\ref{eqn:Stokes}) with $v\in V$ and the
second with $q\in W$, subsequent integration over $\Omega$, and an
application of Green's formula, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{\Omega}\nabla\vec{u}\cdot \nabla\vec{v}-\int_{\Omega}\textrm{div}\vec{v}\, p
&=&\int_{\Omega}\vec{f}\cdot\vec{v}\\
\int_{\Omega}\textrm{div}\vec{u}\, q&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}
This yields the weak form of (\ref{eqn:Stokes}):
Find $(\vec{u},p)\in \vec{V}\times W$ such that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:wStokes-1}
a(\vec{u},\vec{v})+b(\vec{v},p)&=&(\vec{f},\vec{v})\\
\label{eqn:wStokes-2}
b(\vec{u},q)&=&0
\end{eqnarray}
for all $(\vec{v},q)\in V\times W$, where
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:Stokes-a}
a(\vec{u},\vec{v})&=&\int_{\Omega}\nabla \vec{u}\cdot \nabla\vec{v}
=\sum_{i=1}^2\int_{\Omega}\nabla u_i\cdot \nabla v_i\\
\label{eqn:Stokes-b}
b(\vec{u},q)&=&-\int_{\Omega}\textrm{div}\vec{u}\, q
\end{eqnarray}

Now, we consider finite element spaces $\vec{V}_h\subset \vec{V}$ and $W_h\subset W$,
and we assume the following basis functions
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\vec{V}_h=V_h\times V_h,\quad
V_h=\{v_h|\; v_h=v_1\phi_1+\cdots +v_{M_V}\phi_{M_V}\},\\
&&W_h=\{q_h|\; q_h=q_1\varphi_1+\cdots +q_{M_W}\varphi_{M_W}\}
\end{eqnarray*}
The discrete weak form is:
Find $(\vec{u}_{h},p_{h}) \in \vec{V}_{h} \times W_{h}$ such that
\Blue{
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:vfStokes}
    \begin{array}{cll}
   a(\vec{u}_h,\vec{v}_h)+b(\vec{v}_h,p)  &= (\vec{f},\vec{v}_h) ,
      &\forall \vec{v}_{h} \in \vec{V}_{h} \\
    b(\vec{u}_h,q_h)&= 0,
     &\forall q_{h} \in W_{h}
    \end{array}
\end{equation}}
\begin{note}
Assume that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item There is a constant $\alpha_h>0$ such that
  \[
  a(\vec{v}_h,\vec{v}_h)\ge \alpha\| \vec{v}_h\|_{1,\Omega}^2\quad \textrm{for all }\vec{v}_h\in Z_h
  \]
  where
  \[
  Z_h=\{\vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h|\; b(\vec{w}_h,q_h)=0\quad \textrm{for all }q_h\in W_h\}
  \]
  \item There is a constant $\beta_h>0$ such that
  \[
  \sup_{\vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h}\frac{b(\vec{v}_h,q_h)}{\| \vec{v}_h\|_{1,\Omega}}
  \ge \beta_h\| q_h\|_{0,\Omega}\quad \textrm{for all }q_h\in W_h
  \]
\end{enumerate}
  Then we have an unique solution $(\vec{u}_h,p_h)$ of (\ref{eqn:vfStokes})
  satisfying
  \[
  \| \vec{u}-\vec{u}_h\|_{1,\Omega}+\| p-p_h\|_{0,\Omega}
  \le C\left(
  \inf_{\vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h}\| u-v_h\|_{1,\Omega}
  +\inf_{q_h\in W_h}\| p-q_h\|_{0,\Omega}\right)
  \]
  with a constant $C>0$ (see e.g. \cite[Theorem 10.4]{RT93}).
\end{note}
Let us denote that
\begin{eqnarray}
A&=&(A_{ij}),\, A_{ij}=\int_{\Omega}\nabla \phi_j\cdot \nabla \phi_i\qquad
i,j=1,\cdots,M_{\vec{V}}\\
\vec{B}&=&(Bx_{ij},By_{ij}),\,
Bx_{ij}=-\int_{\Omega}\p \phi_j/\p x\, \varphi_i\qquad
By_{ij}=-\int_{\Omega}\p \phi_j/\p y\, \varphi_i\nonumber\\
&&\qquad i=1,\cdots,M_W;j=1,\cdots,M_V\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
then (\ref{eqn:vfStokes}) is written by
\begin{eqnarray}
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\vec{A}&\vec{\vec{B}}^*\\
\vec{B}&0
\end{array}
\right)
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\vec{U}_h\\
\{p_h\}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\vec{F}_h\\
0
\end{array}
\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\vec{A}=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
A&0\\
0&A
\end{array}
\right)
\qquad
\vec{B}^*=\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
Bx^T\\
By^T
\end{array}
\right\}
\qquad
\vec{U}_h=\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
\{u_{1,h}\}\\
\{u_{2,h}\}
\end{array}
\right\}
\qquad
\vec{F}_h=\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
\{\textstyle{\int_{\Omega}f_1\phi_i}\}\\
\{\textstyle{\int_{\Omega}f_2\phi_i}\}
\end{array}
\right\}
\end{eqnarray*}

\textbf{Penalty method:} This method consists of replacing (\ref{eqn:vfStokes}) by a more regular problem: Find
$(\vec{v}_h^{\epsilon},p_h^{\epsilon})\in \vec{V}_h\times \tilde{W}_{h}$ satisfying
\Blue{
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:PvfStokes}
    \begin{array}{cll}
   a(\vec{u}_h^\epsilon,\vec{v}_h)+b(\vec{v}_h,p_h^{\epsilon})  &= (\vec{f},\vec{v}_h) ,
      &\forall \vec{v}_{h} \in \vec{V}_{h} \\
    b(\vec{u}_h^{\epsilon},q_h)-\epsilon(p_h^{\epsilon},q_h)&= 0,
     &\forall q_{h} \in \tilde{W}_{h}
    \end{array}
\end{equation}}
where $\tilde{W}_h\subset L^2(\Omega)$. Formally, we have
\[
\textrm{div}\vec{u}_h^{\epsilon}=\epsilon p_h^{\epsilon}
\]
and the corresponding algebraic problem
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\vec{A}&B^*\\
B&-\epsilon I
\end{array}
\right)
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\vec{U}_h^{\epsilon}\\
\{p_h^{\epsilon}\}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\vec{F}_h\\
0
\end{array}
\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{note}
We can eliminate $p_h^\epsilon=(1/\epsilon)BU_h^{\epsilon}$ to obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:StiffPvfStokes}
(A+(1/\epsilon)B^*B)\vec{U}_h^{\epsilon}=\vec{F}_h^{\epsilon}
\end{eqnarray}
Since the matrix $A+(1/\epsilon)B^*B$ is symmetric, positive-definite, and sparse, (\ref{eqn:StiffPvfStokes}) can be solved by known technique.
There is a constant $C>0$ independent of $\epsilon$ such that
\[
\|\vec{u}_h-\vec{u}_h^\epsilon\|_{1,\Omega}+
\|p_h-p_h^{\epsilon}\|_{0,\Omega}\le C\epsilon
\]
(see e.g. \cite[17.2]{RT93})
\end{note}

\begin{example}[Cavity.edp]

The driven cavity flow problem is solved first at zero Reynolds number
(Stokes flow) and then at Reynolds 100.  \index{fluid}The
velocity pressure formulation is used first and then the calculation
is repeated with the stream function vorticity formulation.

We solve the driven cavity problem by the penalty method (\ref{eqn:PvfStokes}) \index{Stokes} where
 $\vec{u}_{\Gamma}\cdot \vec{n}=0$ and $\vec{u}_{\Gamma}\cdot \vec{s}
=1$ on the top boundary and zero elsewhere ( $\vec{n}$ is the unit normal to $\Gamma$, and $\vec{s}$ the unit tangent to $\Gamma$).
\\
The mesh is constructed by
\bFF
@mesh Th=@square(8,8);
\eFF

We use a classical Taylor-Hood element technic to solve the problem:
\\\\
The velocity is approximated with the $P_{2}$ FE ( $X_{h}$ space), and the
the pressure is approximated with the $P_{1}$ FE ( $M_{h}$ space),
\\\\
where
\Blue{
$$  X_{h} = \left\{ \vec{v} \in H^{1}(]0,1[^2) \left|\; \forall K \in \mathcal{T}_{h}
\quad v_{|K} \in
P_{2} \right.\right\}$$} and
\Blue{$$  M_{h} = \left\{ v \in H^{1}(]0,1[^2) \left|\; \forall K \in \mathcal{T}_{h}
\quad v_{|K} \in
P_{1} \right.\right\}$$}

The FE spaces and functions  are constructed by

\bFF
@fespace Xh(Th,@P2); //  definition of the velocity component space
@fespace Mh(Th,@P1);  //  definition of the pressure space
Xh u2,v2;
Xh u1,v1;
Mh p,q;
\eFF

The Stokes operator is implemented as a system-solve for the velocity
$(u1,u2)$ and the pressure $p$.  The test function  for the velocity is $(v1,v2)$
and $q$ for the pressure, so the variational form (\ref{eqn:vfStokes}) in freefem
language is:
\bFF
@solve Stokes (u1,u2,p,v1,v2,q,solver=Crout) =
    @int2d(Th)( ( dx(u1)*dx(v1) + dy(u1)*dy(v1)
            +  dx(u2)*dx(v2) + dy(u2)*dy(v2) )
            - p*q*(0.000001)
            - p*dx(v1) - p*dy(v2)
            - dx(u1)*q - dy(u2)*q
           )
  + @on(3,u1=1,u2=0)
  + @on(1,2,4,u1=0,u2=0); // see \refSec{Square} for labels 1,2,3,4
\eFF
Each unknown has its own boundary conditions.
\\\\

If the \index{streamlines}streamlines are required, they can be
computed by finding $\psi$ such that rot$\psi=u$ or better,
\Blue{$$-\Delta\psi=\nabla\times u$$}
\bFF
Xh psi,phi;

@solve streamlines(psi,phi) =
      @int2d(Th)( dx(psi)*dx(phi) + dy(psi)*dy(phi))
   +  @int2d(Th)( -phi*(dy(u1)-dx(u2)))
   +  @on(1,2,3,4,psi=0);
\eFF

\bigskip

Now the Navier-Stokes equations are solved
\eq{
    {\p {u}\over\p t} +u\cdot\nabla u-\nu \Delta u+\nabla p=0,~~~ \nabla\cdot u=0
}
with the same boundary conditions and with initial conditions $u=0$.

This is implemented by using the convection operator \texttt{convect} for the term
${\p u\over\p t} +u\cdot\nabla u$, giving a discretization in time
\Blue{\index{Navier-Stokes}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq Navier Stokes carac}
\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{1}{\tau } (u^{n+1}-u^n\circ X^n) -\nu\Delta u^{n+1} + \nabla p^{n+1} &=0,\\
 \nabla\cdot u^{n+1} &= 0
 \end{array}
\end{equation}
}
The term $u^n\circ X^n(x)\approx u^n(x-u^n(x)\tau )$ will be
computed by the operator ``convect" \index{convect} , so we obtain

\subsubsection{\setS{Uzawa} Algorithm and Conjugate Gradients}
We solve Stokes problem without penalty.
The classical iterative method of Uzawa is described by the algorithm
(see e.g.\cite[17.3]{RT93}, \cite[13]{GP79} or \cite[13]{RG84}  ):
\begin{description}
  \item[Initialize:] Let $p_h^0$ be an arbitrary chosen element of
  $L^2(\Omega)$.
  \item[Calculate $\vec{u}_h$:] Once $p_h^n$ is known, $\vec{v}_h^n$ is the solution of
  \[
  \vec{u}_h^n = A^{-1}(\vec{f}_h-\vec{B}^*p_h^n)
  \]
  \item[Advance $p_h$:] Let $p_h^{n+1}$ be defined by
  \[
  p_h^{n+1}=p_h^n+\rho_n\vec{B}\vec{u}_h^n
  \]
\end{description}
There is a constant $\alpha>0$ such that $\alpha\le \rho_n\le 2$ for each $n$,
then $\vec{u}_h^n$ converges to the solution $\vec{u}_h$, and then
$B\vec{v}_h^n\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$ from the \emph{Advance $p_h$}.
This method in general converges quite slowly.

First we define mesh, and the Taylor-Hood \index{Taylor-Hood}  approximation.
So $X_{h}$  is the velocity space, and $M_{h}$ is the pressure space.
\begin{example}[StokesUzawa.edp]~

                    +  on(3,u1=1)  +  @on(1,2,4,u1=0) ;

Xh bc2; bc2   = O ;       //  no boundary condition contribution on u2
Xh b;
\eFF

$p_h^n\to \vec{B}A^{-1}(-\vec{B}^*p_h^n)=-\textrm{div}\vec{u}_h$
is realized as
the function \emph{\texttt{divup}}.
\bFF
@func @real[@int] divup(@real[@int] @& pp)
{
   //  compute u1(pp)
   b[]  = Bx'*pp; b[] *=-1; b[] += bc1[] ;    u1[] = A^-1*b[];
   //  compute u2(pp)
   b[]  = By'*pp; b[] *=-1; b[] += bc2[] ;    u2[] = A^-1*b[];
   //  $\vec{u}^n=A^{-1}(Bx^Tp^n\quad By^Tp^n)^T$ \hfilll

   ppp[] +=  By*u2[];   // $   \quad   +  By u_{2} $
   @return ppp[] ;
};

 Call now the conjugate gradient algorithm:

\bFF

@LinearCG(divup,p[],eps=1.e-6,nbiter=50); // $p_h^{n+1}=p_h^n+\vec{B}\vec{u}_h^n$
// if $n> 50$ or $|p_h^{n+1}-p_h^n|\le 10^{-6}$, then the loop end. \hfilll
divup(p[]); // compute the final solution

@plot([u1,u2],p,wait=1,value=true,coef=0.1);

\subsubsection{NSUzawaCahouetChabart.edp}

 In this example we solve the Navier-Stokes \index{Navier-Stokes} equation,
 in the driven-cavity,
 with the Uzawa  algorithm preconditioned by the Cahouet-Chabart method (see \cite{RG03} for all the details).

 The idea of the preconditioner is that in a periodic domain, all
 differential operators commute and  the  Uzawa algorithm comes to solving the
 linear operator  $ \nabla. ( (\alpha Id + \nu \Delta)^{-1} \nabla$,
 where $ Id $ is the identity operator.
 So  the preconditioer suggested is $ \alpha \Delta^{-1} + \nu Id$.
\\\\
To implement this, we reuse the previous example, by including \index{include} a file.
Then we define the time step $ \Delta t$, viscosity, and new variational form and matrix.

\subsection{Variational  inequality}
We present, a classical example of variational inequality.

Let us denote  $\mathcal{C} = \{ u\in H^1_0(\Omega), u \le g \}$

The problem is :

$$
 u = arg \min_{u\in \mathcal{C}}  J(u) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \nabla u . \nabla u - \int_\Omega f u
$$
where $f$ and $g$ are given function.

The solution is a projection on the convex $\mathcal{C}$ of $f^\star$
for the scalar product $((v,w)) = \int_\Omega \nabla v . \nabla w$ of
$  H^1_0(\Omega)$
where $ {f^\star} $ is solution of $ ((f^\star, v )) = \int_\Omega f v, \forall v \in  H^1_0(\Omega)$.
The projection on a convex satisfy clearly
$\forall v \in \mathcal{C}, \quad   (( u -v ,  u - \tilde{f}  )) \leq 0   $,
and after expanding, we get the classical inequality
$$\forall v \in \mathcal{C}, \quad   \int_\Omega \nabla(u -v) \nabla  u  \leq  \int_\Omega   (u-v) f .   $$

We can also rewrite the problem as a saddle point problem

Find $\lambda, u$ such that:
$$
  \max_{\lambda\in L^2(\Omega), \lambda\geq 0}  \min_{u\in H^1_0(\Omega)}  \mathcal{L}(u,\lambda) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \nabla u . \nabla u - \int_\Omega f u  + \int_{\Omega} \lambda (u-g)^+
$$
where $((u-g)^+ = max(0,u-g) $

This saddle point problem is equivalent to find $ u, \lambda $ such that:
\begin{equation}
 \left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
\displaystyle \int_\Omega \nabla u . \nabla v + \lambda v^+ \,d\omega= \int_\Omega f u  , &\forall v \in H^1_0(\Omega) \cr
\displaystyle \int_\Omega   \mu (u-g)^+ = 0  , & \forall \mu \in L^2(\Omega) , \mu \geq 0, \lambda \geq 0,
 \end{array}\right.\label{eq:iq1}
\end{equation}


A algorithm to solve the previous problem is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item k=0, and choose, $\lambda_0$ belong $ H^{-1}(\Omega)$
\item loop on $ k = 0, .....$
 \begin{enumerate}
\item  set $ \mathcal{I}_{k} = \{ x \in \Omega / \lambda_{k} + c * ( u_{k+1} - g)  \leq 0 \} $
\item  $ V_{g,k+1} = \{ v\in H^1_0(\Omega) / v = g $   on ${I}_{k} \}$,
\item  $ V_{0,k+1} = \{ v\in  H^1_0(\Omega) / v = 0$ on ${I}_{k} \}$,
 \item Find  $ u_{k+1} \in V_{g,k+1} $ and  $\lambda_{k+1} \in H^{-1}(\Omega)$ such that
 $$
 \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
 \displaystyle  \int_\Omega \nabla u_{k+1}. \nabla v_{k+1}   \,d\omega = \int_\Omega f v_{k+1}  , &\forall v_{k+1} \in  V_{0,k+1} \cr
 \displaystyle  <\lambda_{k+1},v>  =  \int_\Omega \nabla u_{k+1}. \nabla v  -  f v \,d\omega &
  \end{array}\right.
 $$
 where $<,>$ is the duality bracket between $ H^{1}_0(\Omega)$ and  $ H^{-1}(\Omega)$, and $c$
is  a penalty constant (large enough).
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
You can find all the mathematic  about this algorithm in \cite{ItoKunisch}.

Now how to do that in \texttt{FreeFem++}

The full example is:

  b = Ik[] .* g[];      b *= tgv;     b  -=  Ak .* rhs;
  Aiin = Ik[] *  tgv;      Aiin  +=  Ak  .* Aii;  //set  Aii= tgv  $ i \in Ik $
  A.diag = Aiin; //  set the matrix diagonal  (appear in version 1.46-1)

      diff= uh[]-uhp[];
      Mdiff = M*diff;
      real err = sqrt(Mdiff'*diff);

\end{example}

Remark, as you can see on this example, some vector , or matrix operator are not implemented
so a way is to skip the expression and we  use operator \texttt{+=},  \texttt{-=} to merge
the result.


\subsection{Domain decomposition}
We present, three classic examples, of domain decomposition
technique:
first, Schwarz algorithm with overlapping, second
Schwarz algorithm without  overlapping (also call Shur complement), and
last we show to use the conjugate gradient
to solve the boundary problem of the Shur complement.

\subsubsection{Schwarz Overlap Scheme}
\label{schwarz-overlap}
To solve
\eq{ -\Delta u =f,\; \hin\Omega=\Omega_1\cup\Omega_2\quad u|_\Gamma=0}
the Schwarz algorithm  runs like this
\Blue{
\begin{eqnarray*}
   -\Delta u^{n+1}_1&=&f\hin\Omega_1\quad
    u^{n+1}_1|_{\Gamma_1}=u^n_2\\
    -\Delta u^{n+1}_2&=&f\hin\Omega_2\quad
    u^{n+1}_2|_{\Gamma_2}=u^n_1
\end{eqnarray*}}
where $\Gamma_i$ is the boundary of $\Omega_i$ and on the
condition that $\Omega_1\cap\Omega_2\neq\emptyset$ and that $u_i$
are zero at iteration 1.
\\\\
Here we take $\Omega_1$ to be a quadrangle, $\Omega_2$ a disk and
we apply the algorithm starting from zero.

\subsubsection{Schwarz non Overlap Scheme}

To solve\index{domain decomposition}\index{shurr}
\eq{ -\Delta u =f \hin\Omega=\Omega_1\cup\Omega_2\quad u|_\Gamma=0,}
the Schwarz algorithm for domain decomposition without overlapping  runs like this

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\HLINE{\hss
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{schwarz-no-th} \hss}
\caption{ The two none overlapping mesh \texttt{TH} and \texttt{th}  }
\end{figure}

Let introduce  $\Gamma_i$ is  common the boundary of $\Omega_1$ and
$\Omega_2$ and    $\Gamma_e^i= \p \Omega_i \setminus \Gamma_i$.

The problem  find  $\lambda$ such that $ (u_1|_{\Gamma_i}=u_2|_{\Gamma_i}) $
where  $u_i$ is solution of the following Laplace problem:
\eq{
    -\Delta u_i=f\hin\Omega_i\quad
    u_i|_{\Gamma_i}=\lambda \quad
    u_i|_{\Gamma_e^i} = 0
 }

To solve this problem we just make a loop
with upgrading$\lambda$ with
$$\lambda = \lambda {\pm} \frac{(u_1-u_2)}{2}$$
where the sign $+$ or $-$ of ${\pm}$ is choose to have convergence.

\begin{example}[Schwarz-no-overlap.edp]~

@for ( i=0 ;i< 10; i++)
{

   pb;
   lambda = lambda - (u-U)/2;

\subsubsection{Schwarz-gc.edp}
To solve\index{domain decomposition}\index{shurr}
\eq{ -\Delta u =f \hin\Omega=\Omega_1\cup\Omega_2\quad u|_\Gamma=0,}
the Schwarz algorithm for domain decomposition without overlapping  runs like this

Let introduce  $\Gamma_i$ is  common the boundary of $\Omega_1$ and
$\Omega_2$ and    $\Gamma_e^i= \p \Omega_i \setminus  \Gamma_i$.

The problem  find  $\lambda$ such that $ (u_1|_{\Gamma_i}=u_2|_{\Gamma_i}) $
where  $u_i$ is solution of the following Laplace problem:
\eq{
    -\Delta u_i=f\hin\Omega_i\quad
    u_i|_{\Gamma_i}=\lambda \quad
    u_i|_{\Gamma_e^i} = 0
 }

The version of this example for  Shur componant. The border problem
is solve with conjugate gradient.

First, we construct the two domain
\begin{example}[Schwarz-gc.edp]~
\index{tutorial!Schwarz-gc.edp}
\bFF
// Schwarz without overlapping (Shur complenement Neumann -> Dirichet)
@real cpu=clock();
@int inside = 2;
@int outside = 1;

@border Gamma1(t=1,2){x=t;y=0;label=outside;};
@border Gamma2(t=0,1){x=2;y=t;label=outside;};
@border Gamma3(t=2,0){x=t ;y=1;label=outside;};

@border GammaInside(t=1,0){x = 1-t; y = t;label=inside;};

@border GammaArc(t=pi/2, 2*pi){ x= cos(t); y = sin(t);label=outside;};
int n=4;
//  build the mesh of $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$
@mesh Th1 = buildmesh( Gamma1(5*n) + Gamma2(5*n) + GammaInside(5*n) + Gamma3(5*n));
@mesh Th2 = buildmesh ( GammaInside(-5*n) + GammaArc(25*n) );
@plot(Th1,Th2);

// defined the 2 FE space
@fespace Vh1(Th1,P1),      Vh2(Th2,P1);
\eFF
\begin{note}
It is impossible to
define a function just on a part of boundary, so the $\ lambda $
function must be defined on the all domain $\Omega_1$
such as
\bFF
@Vh1 lambda=0;  // take $\lambda \in V_{h1}$
\eFF
\end{note}

The two Poisson problem:
\bFF
@Vh1 u1,v1;              Vh2 u2,v2;
@int i=0;  // for factorization optimization
@problem Pb2(u2,v2,init=i,solver=Cholesky) =
    int2d(Th2)( dx(u2)*dx(v2)+dy(u2)*dy(v2) )
  + int2d(Th2)( -v2)
  + int1d(Th2,inside)(-lambda*v2) +    on(outside,u2= 0 ) ;
@problem Pb1(u1,v1,init=i,solver=Cholesky) =
    int2d(Th1)( dx(u1)*dx(v1)+dy(u1)*dy(v1) )
  + int2d(Th1)( -v1)
  + int1d(Th1,inside)(+lambda*v1) +    on(outside,u1 = 0 ) ;
\eFF
or, we define a border matrix , because the
 $\ lambda $ function is none zero inside the domain $\Omega_1$:
\bFF
@varf b(u2,v2,solver=CG) =int1d(Th1,inside)(u2*v2);
@matrix B= b(Vh1,Vh1,solver=CG);
\eFF

The boundary problem function,
  $$
  \lambda \longrightarrow  \int_{\Gamma_i }(u_1-u_2) v_{1}
$$
\bFF
@func @real[@int] BoundaryProblem(real[int] &l)

   v1=-(u1-u2);

   @return lambda[] ;
};
\eFF
\begin{note}
The  difference between the two notations \ttCC{v1} and \ttCC{v1[]}  is:

\subsection{Fluid/Structures Coupled Problem}

This problem involves the Lam\'{e} system of elasticity
and the Stokes system for viscous fluids with velocity $\vec u$ and pressure $p$:
\begin{eqnarray*}\Blue
-\Delta \vec u +\vec\nabla p = 0, \,
%\`{u}
\nabla\cdot \vec u = 0,\hbox{~~in ~}\Omega,\,
\vec u=\vec u_\Gamma \hbox{~~on~~}\Gamma=\p\Omega
\end{eqnarray*}\Black
where $u_\Gamma$ is the velocity of the boundaries. The
force  that the fluid applies to the boundaries is the normal stress
\Blue{$$
\vec h =(\nabla\vec u +\nabla\vec u^T)\vec n -p\vec n
$$}

Elastic solids subject to forces deform: a point in the solid,
at (x,y)
goes to (X,Y) after.  When the displacement vector
$\vec v=(v_1,v_2) = (X-x, Y-y)$  is small, Hooke's
law relates the stress tensor $\sigma$ inside the solid to the
deformation tensor $\epsilon$:
\Blue{
 $$ \sigma_{ij} = \lambda \delta_{ij} \nabla.\vec v + 2\mu\epsilon_{ij},
\,
\epsilon_{ij} = {1\over 2}({\p v_i\over\p x_j} +
{\p v_j\over\p x_i} )$$
}
where $\delta$ is the Kronecker symbol
and where $\lambda, \mu$ are two constants describing the material mechanical
properties in terms of the modulus of
elasticity, and Young's modulus.

The equations of elasticity are naturally written in variational form
for the displacement vector $v(x)\in V$ as
\Blue{$$
\int_\Omega [2\mu\epsilon_{ij}(\vec v)\epsilon_{ij}(\vec w)
+\lambda \epsilon_{ii}(v)\epsilon_{jj}(\vec w)]
=\int_\Omega \vec g\cdot \vec w +\int_\Gamma \vec h\cdot \vec w,%\`{u}
\forall \vec w\in V
$$}
The data are the gravity force $\vec g$ and the
boundary stress $\vec h$.

\begin{example}[fluidStruct.edp]
\index{tutorial!fluidStruct.edp}
In our example the Lam\'{e} system and the Stokes system are coupled by a
common boundary on which
the fluid  stress creates a displacement of the boundary and hence
changes the shape of the domain where the Stokes problem is integrated.
The geometry is that of a vertical driven cavity with an elastic lid.
The lid is a beam with weight so it will
be deformed by its own weight and by the normal stress due to the fluid reaction.
The cavity is the $10 \times 10$ square and the lid is a rectangle of height $l=2$.
\\\\
A beam sits on a box full of fluid rotating because the left vertical side has velocity one.
The beam is bent by its own weight, but the pressure of the fluid modifies the bending.
\\
The bending displacement of the beam is given by (uu,vv) whose solution is
given as follows.
\bFF
//  Fluid-structure interaction for a weighting beam sitting on a
// square cavity filled with a fluid.

\eFF
Then Stokes equation for fluids ast low speed are solved in the box below the beam,
but the beam has deformed the box (see border h):
\bFF
//Stokes on square  b,e,f,g  driven cavite on left side g
@border e(t=0,10) { x=t; y=-10; label= 1; };      //  bottom

@border g(t=0,10) { x=0; y=-t ;label= 2;};       //  left
@border h(t=0,10) { x=t; y=vv(t,0)*( t>=0.001 )*(t <= 9.999);
                    label=3;};   //  top of cavity deformed

@mesh sh = @buildmesh(h(-20)+f(10)+e(10)+g(10));
@plot(sh,wait=1);
\eFF
 We use the Uzawa conjugate gradient to solve the Stokes problem like in example \refSec{Uzawa}

\bFF
@fespace Xh(sh,P2),Mh(sh,P1);
Xh u1,u2,v1,v2;
Mh p,q,ppp;


@varf bx(u1,q) = @int2d(sh)( -(dx(u1)*q));

@varf by(u1,q) = @int2d(sh)( -(dy(u1)*q));

@varf Lap(u1,u2)= @int2d(sh)(  dx(u1)*dx(u2) + dy(u1)*dy(u2) )
                    +  @on(2,u1=1) +  @on(1,3,u1=0)  ;

Xh bc1; bc1[] = Lap(0,Xh);
Xh brhs;

@matrix A= Lap(Xh,Xh,solver=CG);
@matrix Bx= bx(Xh,Mh);
@matrix By= by(Xh,Mh);
Xh bcx=0,bcy=1;

@func @real[@int] divup(@real[@int] & pp)
{
  @int verb=verbosity;
   verbosity=0;
   brhs[]  = Bx'*pp; brhs[] += bc1[] .*bcx[];
   u1[] = A^-1*brhs[];
   brhs[]  = By'*pp; brhs[] += bc1[] .*bcy[];
   u2[] = A^-1*brhs[];
   ppp[] =   Bx*u1[];
   ppp[] +=  By*u2[];
   verbosity=verb;
   @return ppp[] ;
};
\eFF

do a loop on the two problem
\bFF
@for(@step=0;step<2;++step)
 {
   p=0;q=0;u1=0;v1=0;

   @LinearCG(divup,p[],eps=1.e-3,nbiter=50);
   divup(p[]);
\eFF
Now the beam will feel the stress constraint from the fluid:
\bFF
  Vh sigma11,sigma22,sigma12;
  Vh uu1=uu,vv1=vv;

  sigma11([x+uu,y+vv]) = (2*dx(u1)-p);
  sigma22([x+uu,y+vv]) = (2*dy(u2)-p);
  sigma12([x+uu,y+vv]) = (dx(u1)+dy(u2));
\eFF
which comes as a boundary condition to the PDE of the beam:
\bFF
  @solve  bbst([uu,vv],[w,s],init=i)  =
     @int2d(th)(
                  lambda*@div(w,s)*@div(uu,vv)
                  +2.*mu*( @epsilon(w,s)'*@epsilon(uu,vv) )
              )
  + @int2d(th) (-gravity*s)
  + @int1d(th,bottombeam)( -coef*(   sigma11*N.x*w + sigma22*N.y*s
                                   + sigma12*(N.y*w+N.x*s) )  )
  + @on(1,uu=0,vv=0);
  @plot([uu,vv],wait=1);
  @real  err = sqrt(@int2d(th)( (uu-uu1)^2 + (vv-vv1)^2 ));
  @cout <<  " Erreur L2 = " << err << "----------\n";
\eFF

Notice that the matrix generated by bbst is reused (see \ttCC{init=i}).
Finally we deform the beam
\bFF
 th1 = @movemesh(th, [x+0.2*uu, y+0.2*vv]);
 @plot(th1,wait=1);
 } // end of loop

\subsection{\setS{Transmission Problem}}
Consider an elastic plate whose displacement change vertically,
which is made up of three plates of different materials,
welded on each other.
Let $\Omega_i,\, i=1,2,3$ be the domain occupied by $i$-th material
with tension $\mu_i$ (see \refSec{Soap Film}).
The computational domain $\Omega$ is the interior of
$\overline{\Omega_1}\cup \overline{\Omega_2}\cup \overline{\Omega_3}$.
The vertical displacement $u(x,y)$ is obtained from
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:transm-1}
-\mu_i\Delta u&=&f~\textrm{in }\Omega_i\\
\label{eqn:transm-2}
\mu_i\p_n u|_{\Gamma_{i}}&=&-\mu_j\p_n u|_{\Gamma_{j}}
\quad \textrm{on }\overline{\Omega_{i}}\cap\overline{\Omega_{j}}
\qquad \textrm{if }1\le i< j\le 3
\end{eqnarray}
where $\p_n u|_{\Gamma_{i}}$ denotes the value of
the normal derivative $\p_n u$ on the boundary $\Gamma_i$ of
the domain $\Omega_i$.

By introducing the characteristic function $\chi_i$ of $\Omega_i$, that is,
\begin{equation}
\chi_i(x)=1\quad\textrm{if }x\in \Omega_i;\qquad
\chi_i(x)=0\quad\textrm{if }x\not\in \Omega_i
\end{equation}
we can easily rewrite (\ref{eqn:transm-1}) and (\ref{eqn:transm-2})
to the weak form. Here we assume that $u=0$ on $\Gamma=\p\Omega$.

problem Transmission: For a given function $f$, find $u$ such that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:transmission}
a(u,v)&=&\ell(f,v)\quad \textrm{for all }v\in H^1_0(\Omega)\\
a(u,v)=\int_{\Omega}\mu \nabla u\cdot \nabla v,\quad
\ell(f,v)=\int_{\Omega}fv\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mu=\mu_1\chi_1+\mu_2\chi_2+\mu_3\chi_3$.
Here we notice that $\mu$ become the discontinuous function.

With dissipation, and at the thermal equilibrium, the temperature equation
is:

This example explains the definition and manipulation of \emph{region}, i.e.
\index{subdomains} subdomains of the whole domain.

Consider this L-shaped domain with 3 diagonals as internal boundaries, defining
4 subdomains:

\bFF
//   example using region keyword
// construct a mesh with 4 regions (sub-domains)
border a(t=0,1){x=t;y=0;};
border b(t=0,0.5){x=1;y=t;};
border c(t=0,0.5){x=1-t;y=0.5;};
border d(t=0.5,1){x=0.5;y=t;};
border e(t=0.5,1){x=1-t;y=1;};
border f(t=0,1){x=0;y=1-t;};
//  internal boundary
border i1(t=0,0.5){x=t;y=1-t;};
border i2(t=0,0.5){x=t;y=t;};
border i3(t=0,0.5){x=1-t;y=t;};

mesh th = buildmesh (a(6) + b(4) + c(4) +d(4) + e(4) +
    f(6)+i1(6)+i2(6)+i3(6));
fespace Ph(th,P0);  // constant discontinuous functions / element
fespace Vh(th,P1);  // $P_1$ continuous functions / element

Ph reg=region; //  defined the $P_0$ function  associated to region number
plot(reg,fill=1,wait=1,value=1);
\eFF
\twoplot[height=8cm]{region}{region_nu}{the function \texttt{reg}}{the function \texttt{nu} }

\index{region} \texttt{region}  is a keyword of \texttt{FreeFem++} which is in fact a variable depending of
the current position (is not a function today, use \texttt{Ph reg=region;} to  set  a function).  This variable value returned is the number of the
subdomain of the current position.  This number is defined by "buildmesh" which scans while building the mesh all
its connected component.  So to get the number of a region containing a particular point
one does:
\bFF

int nupper=reg(0.4,0.9); // get the region number of point (0.4,0.9)
int nlower=reg(0.9,0.1);  // get the region number of point (0.4,0.1)
cout << " nlower " <<  nlower << ", nupper = " << nupper<< endl;
//  defined the characteristics functions of upper and lower region
Ph nu=1+5*(region==nlower) + 10*(region==nupper);
plot(nu,fill=1,wait=1);
\eFF
This is particularly useful to define \index{discontinuous functions}discontinuous functions such as might occur
when one part of the domain is copper and the other one is iron, for example.
\\
We this in mind we proceed to solve a Laplace equation with discontinuous coefficients
($\nu$ is 1, 6 and 11 below).
\bFF
Ph nu=1+5*(region==nlower) + 10*(region==nupper);
plot(nu,fill=1,wait=1);
problem lap(u,v) =   int2d(th)( nu*( dx(u)*dx(v)*dy(u)*dy(v) ))
                   + int2d(-1*v) + on(a,b,c,d,e,f,u=0);
plot(u);
\eFF
\plot[height=8cm]{region_u}{the isovalue of the solution $u$}

@int n=4;

@plot(Th,ps="dTh.eps");
\eFF


\begin{figure}[hbt]
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{dTh}
\caption{The mesh of the domain $\Omega$}
\end{figure}

The free boundary problem is:

Find $u$ and $\Omega$ such that:

 $$ \left\{\begin{array}{cl}
 \displaystyle - \Delta u = 0  & \mbox{in } \Omega\\
 \displaystyle      u = y         &\mbox{on } \Gamma_b \\
 \displaystyle      {\p u  \over \p n} = 0   &\mbox{on } \Gamma_d \cup \Gamma_a \\
 \displaystyle    {\p u  \over \p n} = { q\over K} n_x
          \mbox{\ and \ } {u = y}  &\mbox{on\ } \Gamma_ f
\end{array}\right. $$


We use a fixed point method;
$\Omega^0 = \Omega$

in two step, fist we solve the classical following problem:
$$ \left\{\begin{array}{rll}
 \displaystyle - \Delta u &= 0  & \mbox{in } \Omega^n\\
 \displaystyle      u &= y         &\mbox{on } \Gamma^n_b \\
 \displaystyle      {\p u  \over \p n} &= 0   &\mbox{on } \Gamma^n_d \cup \Gamma^n_a\\
 \displaystyle    u &= y        &\mbox{on\ } \Gamma^n_ f
\end{array}\right. $$

The variational formulation is:

find $u$ on $V=H^1(\Omega^n)$, such than  $u=y$ on $\Gamma^n_b$ and $\Gamma^n_f$
$$
 \int_{\Omega^n}  \nabla u \nabla u' = 0,  \quad \forall u' \in V  \mbox{ with }  u' =0 \mbox{ on }
\Gamma^n_b \cup \Gamma^n_f
$$


and secondly to construct a domain deformation $\mathcal{F}(x,y)=[x,y-v(x,y)]$

where $v$ is  solution of  the following problem:

 $$ \left\{\begin{array}{rll}
 \displaystyle - \Delta v &= 0  & \mbox{in } \Omega^n\\
 \displaystyle      v  &= 0         &\mbox{on } \Gamma^n_a \\
 \displaystyle      {\p v \over \p n} &= 0   &\mbox{on } \Gamma^n_b \cup \Gamma^n_d \\
 \displaystyle    {\p v  \over \p n}  &=  \displaystyle {\p u  \over \p n} - { q\over K} n_x
            &\mbox{on\ } \Gamma^n_ f
\end{array}\right. $$

The variational formulation is:

find $v$ on $V$, such than  $v=0$ on $\Gamma^n_a$
$$
 \int_{\Omega^n}  \nabla v \nabla v' = \int_{\Gamma_f^n}  ({\p u  \over \p n} - { q\over K} n_x )v',  \quad \forall v' \in V  \mbox{ with }  v' =0 \mbox{ on }
\Gamma^n_a
$$

Finally the new domain
$\Omega^{n+1} = \mathcal{F}(\Omega^n)$

\textBlack\subsection{Non linear Elasticity (nolinear-elas.edp)}
\textBlack
The nonlinear elasticity  problem is: find  the displacement $(u_{1},u_{2})$  minimizing  $J$
$$ \min J(u_{1},u_{2}) = \int_{\Omega} f(F2) -  \int_{\Gamma_{p}} P_{a} \,  u_{2} $$
where  $F2(u_{1},u_{2}) =  A(E[u_{1},u_{2}],E[u_{1},u_{2}])$ and $A(X,Y)$ is bilinear sym. positive form with respect two matrix $X,Y$.
where $f$ is a given $\mathcal{C}^2$  function, and $E[u_{1},u_{2}] = (E_{ij})_{i=1,2,\,j=1,2}$ is the Green-Saint Venant deformation tensor defined  with:
$$  E_{ij} = 0.5 \big( ( \p_i u_j + \p_j u_i ) + \sum_k \p_i u_k {\times} \p_j u_k \big) $$

Denote $\mathbf{u}=(u_{1},u_{2})$, $\mathbf{v}=(v_{1},v_{2})$, $\mathbf{w}=(w_{1},w_{2})$.

So, the differential of $J$ is
  $$ DJ(\bm{u})(\bm{v}) =  \int  DF2(\bm{u})(\bm{v}) \;f'(F2(\bm{u}))) -  \int_{\Gamma_{p}} P_{a}  v_{2}  $$
  where  $ DF2(\bm{u})(\bm{v}) = 2 \; A(\;DE[\mathbf{u}](\mathbf{v})\;,\;E[\mathbf{u}]\;) $ and  $DE$ is the first  differential of $E$.


The second order differential is
 {\begin{eqnarray*}
 D^2 J(\mathbf{u})((\mathbf{v}),(\mathbf{w}))  &=& \displaystyle\int  DF2(\bm{u})(\bm{v}) \; DF2(\bm{u})(\bm{w}) \; f''(F2(\mathbf{u}))) \\
 & +&  \displaystyle\int \; D^2F2(\bm{u})(\bm{v},\bm{w}) \; f'(F2(\mathbf{u})))
\end{eqnarray*}}
 where
  $$
  D^2F2(\bm{u})(\bm{v},\bm{w}) = 2 \; A(\;D^2E[\mathbf{u}](\bm{v},\bm{w})\;,\;E[\bm{u}]\;) + 2 \; A(\;DE[\bm{u}](\bm{v})\;,DE[\bm{u}](\bm{w})\;) .$$
 and $D^{2}E$ is the  second differential of $E$.
 \medskip

So all notations  can be define with \texttt{macro}s:

\bFF
@macro EL(u,v) [dx(u),(dx(v)+dy(u)),dy(v)] // is $[\epsilon_{11},2\epsilon_{12},\epsilon_{22}]$

@macro ENL(u,v) [
(dx(u)*dx(u)+dx(v)*dx(v))*0.5,
(dx(u)*dy(u)+dx(v)*dy(v))    ,
(dy(u)*dy(u)+dy(v)*dy(v))*0.5 ] // EOM ENL

@macro dENL(u,v,uu,vv) [(dx(u)*dx(uu)+dx(v)*dx(vv)),
 (dx(u)*dy(uu)+dx(v)*dy(vv)+dx(uu)*dy(u)+dx(vv)*dy(v)),
 (dy(u)*dy(uu)+dy(v)*dy(vv)) ] //


@macro E(u,v) (EL(u,v)+ENL(u,v)) // is $[E_{11},2E_{12},E_{22}]$
@macro dE(u,v,uu,vv) (EL(uu,vv)+dENL(u,v,uu,vv)) //
@macro ddE(u,v,uu,vv,uuu,vvv) dENL(uuu,vvv,uu,vv) //
@macro F2(u,v) (E(u,v)'*A*E(u,v)) //
@macro dF2(u,v,uu,vv)  (E(u,v)'*A*dE(u,v,uu,vv)*2. ) //
@macro ddF2(u,v,uu,vv,uuu,vvv) (
            (dE(u,v,uu,vv)'*A*dE(u,v,uuu,vvv))*2.
          + (E(u,v)'*A*ddE(u,v,uu,vv,uuu,vvv))*2.  )// EOM
\eFF

The Newton Method is

choose $ n=0$,and $u_O,v_O$ the initial displacement
\begin{itemize}
\item loop: \\
\item  \hspace{1cm}    find $(du,dv)$ :  solution of
$$ D^2J(u_n,v_n)((w,s),(du,dv)) =  DJ(u_n,v_n)(w,s) , \quad \forall w,s $$
\item  \hspace{1cm}      $un =un - du,\quad vn =vn - dv$
\item  \hspace{1cm}      until $(du,dv)$ small is enough
\end{itemize}

\color{black}The way to implement this algorithm in \freefempp is
use a macro tool to implement  $A$ and $F2$, $f$, $f'$,$f''$.

A macro\label{macro}\index{macro} is like in \texttt{ccp} preprocessor of \Cpp, but this begin by
\texttt{macro} and the end of the macro definition is before  the comment $//$.
In this case the macro is very useful because the type of parameter can be change.
And it is easy to make automatic differentiation.

\subsubsection{Notation}
In what follows, the symbols $\vec{u}, \bF, \bB, \bC, \stress$
denote, respectively, the displacement field, the deformation
gradient, the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor $\bB = \bF \bF^T$, the
right Cauchy-Green strain tensor $\bC =\bF^T \bF$, and the Cauchy stress
tensor.  We also introduce the symbols $I_1 := \tr \bC$ and $J := \det
\bF$.  Use will be made of the identity
\eqn
{\PD{}J \over \PD{}\bC} = J \bC^{-1}
\nqe
The symbol $\Id$ denotes the identity tensor.  The symbol $\Omega_{0}$
denotes the reference configuration of the body to be deformed.  The
unit volume in the reference (resp., deformed) configuration is
denoted $dV$ (resp., $dV_{0}$); these two are related by
$$
dV = J dV_{0},
$$
which allows an integral over $\Omega$ involving the Cauchy stress
$\bT$ to be rewritten as an integral of the Kirchhoff stress $\kappa =
J \bT$ over $\Omega_{0}$.

\subsubsection{A Neo-Hookean Compressible Material}

\paragraph{Constitutive Theory and Tangent Stress Measures}

The strain energy density function is given by
\eqn
W = {\mu \over 2}(I_1 - \tr \Id - 2 \ln J)
%% + \mu_1 (J - 1)^2
\nqe
(see \cite{Horgan-Saccomandi}, formula (12)).

The corresponding 2nd Piola-Kirchoff stress tensor is given by
\eqn
\bS_{n} := {\PD{} W \over \PD{}\bE} (\bF_{n})
=
\mu (\Id - \bC^{-1})
\nqe
The Kirchhoff stress, then, is
\eqn
\kappa
= \bF \bS \bF^{T}
= \mu (\bB  - \Id)
\nqe
The tangent Kirchhoff stress tensor at $\bF_{n}$ acting on
$
\delta \bF_{n+1}
$ is, consequently,
\eqn
{\PD{} \kappa \over \PD{} \bF} (\bF_{n}) \delta \bF_{n+1}
=
\mu
\left[
\bF_{n} (\delta \bF_{n+1})^T
+
\delta \bF_{n+1} (\bF_{n})^T
\right]
\nqe

\paragraph{The Weak Form of the BVP in the Absence of Body (External) Forces}

The $\Omega_0$ we are considering is an elliptical annulus, whose
boundary consists of two concentric ellipses (each allowed to be a
circle as a special case), with the major axes parallel.  Let $P$ denote the dead stress load (traction) on a portion
$\partial \Omega_0^{t}$ (= the inner ellipse) of the boundary
$\partial \Omega_0$.  On the rest of the boundary, we prescribe zero displacement.

The weak formulation of the boundary value
problem is
$$
\arr{lll}
0
& = &
\int_{\Omega_0}
\kappa[\bF]
\:
:
\:
\left\{
(\Grad \otimes \vec{w}) (\bF)^{-1}
\right\}\\
& - & \int_{\PD{} \Omega_0^{t}} P \cdot \hat{N}_0\\
\rra
$$
{\em
For brevity, in the rest of this section we assume $P = 0$.  The provided
FreeFem++ code, however, does not rely on this assumption and allows
for a general value and direction of $P$.}

Given a Newton approximation $\vec{u}_n$ of the displacement field
$\vec{u}$ satisfying the BVP, we seek the  correction $\delta \vec{u}_{n+1}$ to
obtain a better approximation
$$
\vec{u}_{n+1} = \vec{u}_{n} + \delta \vec{u}_{n+1}
$$
by solving the weak formulation
\eqn
\arr{lll}
0
& = &
\int_{\Omega_0}
\kappa[\bF_{n} + \delta \bF_{n+1}]
\:
:
\:
\left\{
(\Grad \otimes \vec{w}) (\bF_{n} + \delta \bF_{n+1})^{-1}
\right\}
- \int_{\PD{} \Omega_0} P \cdot \hat{N}_0
\\
& = &
\int_{\Omega_0}
\left\{
\kappa[\bF_{n}] +
{\PD{} \kappa \over \PD{} \bF}[\bF_{n}]
\delta \bF_{n+1}
\right\}
\:
:
\:
\left\{
(\Grad \otimes \vec{w})
(\bF_{n} + \delta \bF_{n+1})^{-1}
\right\}
\\
& = &
\int_{\Omega_0}
\left\{
\kappa[\bF_{n}] +
{\PD{} \kappa \over \PD{} \bF}[\bF_{n}]
\delta \bF_{n+1}
\right\}
\:
:
\:
\left\{
(\Grad \otimes \vec{w}) (\bF_{n}^{-1} + \bF_{n}^{-2} \delta \bF_{n+1})
\right\}
\\
\\
& = &
\int_{\Omega_0}
\kappa[\bF_{n}]
\:
:
\:
\left\{
(\Grad \otimes \vec{w})
\bF_{n}^{-1}
\right\}\\
&-&
\int_{\Omega_0}
\kappa[\bF_{n}]
\:
:
\:
\left\{
(\Grad \otimes \vec{w})
(\bF_{n}^{-2} \delta \bF_{n+1})
\right\}\\
&+&
\int_{\Omega_0}

\right\}
\:

\left\{
(
\Grad \otimes \vec{w})
\bF_{n}^{-1}
\right\}
\\
\rra
\quad
\mbox{for all test functions $\vec{w}$,}
\nqe
where we have taken
$$
\delta \bF_{n+1} = \Grad \otimes \delta \vec{u}_{n+1}
$$

{\bf Note:}  Contrary to standard notational use, the symbol $\delta$
here bears no variational context.  By $\delta$ we mean simply an
increment in the sense of Newton's Method.  The role of a variational virtual displacement here
is played by $\vec{w}$.

\subsubsection{An Approach to Implementation in {\tt FreeFem++}}

The associated file is  \texttt{examples++-tutorial/nl-elast-neo-Hookean.edp}.

Introducing the code-like notation, where a string in $< >$'s is to be
read as one symbol, the individual components of the tensor
\eqn
<TanK>
 :=
{\PD{} \kappa \over \PD{} \bF}[\bF_{n}]
\delta \bF_{n+1}
\nqe
will be implemented as the macros $<TanK11>, <TanK12>, \ldots$.

The individual components of the tensor quantities
$$
\bD_{1} :=
\bF_{n} (\delta \bF_{n+1})^T
+
\delta \bF_{n+1} (\bF_{n})^T,
$$
$$
\bD_{2} :=
\bF_{n}^{-T} \delta \bF_{n+1},
$$
$$
\bD_{3} :=
(\Grad \otimes \vec{w})
\bF_{n}^{-2} \delta \bF_{n+1},
$$
and
$$
\bD_{4} :=
(\Grad \otimes \vec{w})
\bF_{n}^{-1},
$$
will be implemented as the macros
\eqn
\label{equation:aux-macros}
\arr{l}
<d1Aux11>, <d1Aux12>, \quad \ldots \quad, <d1Aux22>,\\
<d2Aux11>, <d2Aux12>, \quad \ldots \quad, <d2Aux22>\\
<d3Aux11>, <d3Aux12>, \quad \ldots \quad, <d3Aux22>\\
<d4Aux11>, <d4Aux12>, \quad \ldots \quad, <d4Aux22>\\
\rra,
\nqe
respectively.

In the above notation, the tangent Kirchhoff stress term becomes
\eqn
{\PD{} \kappa \over \PD{} \bF} (\bF_{n})
\: \delta \bF_{n+1}
=
\mu
\: \bD_{1}
\nqe
while the weak BVP formulation acquires the form
\eqn
\arr{lll}
0 & = &
\int_{\Omega_0}
\kappa[\bF_{n}]
\:
:
\:
\bD_{4}
\\
&-&
\int_{\Omega_0}
\kappa[\bF_{n}]
\:
:
\:
\bD_{3}
\\
&+&
\int_{\Omega_0}
\left\{
{\PD{} \kappa \over \PD{} \bF}[\bF_{n}]
\delta \bF_{n+1}
\right\}
\:
:
\:
\bD_{4}
\\
\rra
\quad
\mbox{for all test functions $\vec{w}$}

To solve the following Poisson problem 
on domain $\Omega$ with boundary $\Gamma$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ :

$$
 -\Delta u = f,  \mbox{ in } \Omega,\mbox{ and } u= g \mbox{ on } \Gamma,
$$
 where $ f$ and $g$ are two given functions of $L^2(\Omega)$ and of $H^{\frac12}(\Gamma)$,



Let introduce   $(\pi_i)_{i=1,.., N_p}$ a regular partition of the unity  of $\Omega$, q-e-d:
$$ \pi_i \in \mathcal{C}^0(\Omega) : \quad  \pi_i\ge 0 \mbox{ and } \sum_{i=1}^{N_p} \pi_i =1 .$$
Denote $ \Omega_i$ the sub domain which is the support of $\pi_i$ function and also denote $\Gamma_i$ the boundary 
of $\Omega_i$.

The parallel Schwarz 	method is 
Let $\ell=0$ the iterator and a initial guest $u^0$  respecting the boundary condition (i.e. 
$u^0_{|\Gamma} = g$).

After discretization with the Lagrange finite element method, with a compatible mesh $\Th_i$ of $\Omega_i$,
i. e., the exist a global mesh $\Th$ such that  $\Th_i$ is include in $\Th$. 
Let us denote:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Vh_i$ the finite element space corresponding to domain $\Omega_i$, 
\item  $\Nh_i$ is the set of the   degree of freedom $\sigma_i^k $,
\item  $\Nhgi_{i}$ is the set of 
the   degree of freedom of $\Vh_i$ on the boundary $\Gamma_i$ of $\Omega_i$, 
\item  $\sigma_i^k(\vh)$  is the value  the degree of freedom $k$,
\item $\VOh_i=  \{ \vh \in \Vh_i :\forall  k \in  \Nhgi_{i}, \quad \sigma_i^k(\vh)=0 \}$,
\item the conditional expression $ a\;?\;b:c $ is defined like in \texttt{C} of \texttt{C++} language by 
$$  a?b: c \equiv
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\mbox{if  $a$ is true  then return $b$}\\
\mbox{else return $c$}  \\
\end{array}
\right..
$$

\end{itemize}
 
 
\medskip 


{\bf Remark} we never use finite element space associated to the full domain $\Omega$ because it to expensive.

\medskip 



We have to defined to operator to build the  previous algorithm:

We denote $\uh^{\ell}_{|i}$  the restriction of $ u_h^\ell$ on $\Vh_i$, so  the discrete problem on $\Omega_i$ 
of problem (\ref{eq:lapl}) is find $\uh^{\ell}_{i}\in \Vh_i$ such that:
%% FFCS: this does not compile because of \uh^ and \Nhgi_. Just wait
%% for a working version.
%%%\begin{equation} 
%%%\forall \vh_i\in V_{0i}: \int_{\Omega_i} \nabla \vh_i . \nabla \uh^{\ell}_{i} = \int_{\Omega_i} f  \vh_i ,\quad \forall  k \in \Nhgi_{i}\;:\;  \sigma_i^k(\uh^\ell_i) =  (k\in \Gamma) \; ? \; g_i^k : \sigma_i^k(\uh^{\ell}_{|i}) 
%%%\end{equation}
where $g_i^k$ is the value of $g$ associated to the degree of freedom $k\in \Nhgi_{i} $.

In FreeFem++, it can be written has with \texttt{U} is the vector corresponding to $\uh^{\ell}_{|i}$ and the 
vector \texttt{U1}  is the vector corresponding to $\uh^\ell_{i}$  is the solution of: 

\bFF
  @real[int] U1(Ui.n); 
  @real[int] b= onG .* U; 
  b  = onG ? b : Bi ;  
  U1 = Ai^-1*b;	
  
\eFF
where 
 $\mathtt{onG}[i] =(i \in \Gamma_i\setminus\Gamma) ? 1 : 0   $, and $\mathtt{Bi}$
the right of side of the problem, are defined  by 


\bFF
  @fespace Whi(Thi,P2); // def of the Finite element space.
  @varf vPb(U,V)= @int3d(Thi)(grad(U)'*grad(V)) + int3d(Thi)(F*V) +on(1,U=g) + on(10,U=G);  
  @varf vPbon(U,V)=@on(10,U=1)+@on(1,U=0);
  @matrix Ai = vPb(Whi,Whi,solver=sparsesolver);
  @real[int] onG = vPbon(0,Whi);
  @real[int] Bi=vPb(0,Whi);  
\eFF\smallskip
where  the freefem++  label of $\Gamma$ is 1 and the label of
$\Gamma_i\setminus \Gamma$ is $10$.


\medskip
To build the transfer/update part corresponding to (\ref{eq:pu1}) equation  
 on process $i$, let us call  \texttt{njpart} the number  the neighborhood of domain of $\Omega_i$
(i.e: $\pi_j$ is none $0$ of $\Omega_i$), we store in an array \texttt{jpart} of size  \texttt{njpart} 
 all this  neighborhood. 
Let us introduce two  array of  matrix,
\texttt{Smj[j]} to defined the vector to send from $i$ to $j$ a neighborhood process,
and the matrix $rMj[j]$ to after to  reduce owith  neighborhood $j$ domain.   

So the tranfert and update part  compute 
$v_i= \pi_i u_i + \sum_{j\in J_i} \pi_j  u_j  $ and  can be write  the
freefem++ function Update:
\bFF
@func @bool Update(@real[@int] &ui, @real[@int] &vi)
{ @int n= jpart.n;
  @for(@int j=0;j<njpart;++j)  Usend[j][]=sMj[j]*ui;  	
  @mpiRequest[int] rq(n*2);
  @for (int j=0;j<n;++j) @Irecv(processor(jpart[j],comm,rq[j  ]), Ri[j][]);       
  @for (int j=0;j<n;++j) @Isend(processor(jpart[j],comm,rq[j+n]), Si[j][]); 
  @for (int j=0;j<n*2;++j) @int k= mpiWaitAny(rq);
  // apply the unity local partition .\hfilll
   vi = Pii*ui;// set to $ \pi_i u_i$
   @for(@int j=0;j<njpart;++j)  vi += rMj[j]*Vrecv[j][]; // add $\pi_j  u_j$ 
   @return @true; }
\eFF\smallskip
where the buffer are defined by:
\smallskip\bFF
  InitU(njpart,Whij,Thij,aThij,Usend)  // defined the send buffer\hfilll
  InitU(njpart,Whij,Thij,aThij,Vrecv)  //  defined the revc buffer\hfilll
\eFF\smallskip
with the following macro definition: 
\smallskip\bFF
@macro InitU(n,Vh,Th,aTh,U) Vh[int] U(n); @for(@int j=0;j<n;++j) {Th=aTh[j];  U[j]=0;}//

{\bf First \texttt{gmres} algorithm:}  you can easily accelerate  the fixe point algorithm by using  a parallel \texttt{GMRES} algorithm  after the introduction the following affine $\mathcal{A}_i$ operator
sub domain $\Omega_i$. 
\smallskip\bFF
@func @real[@int] DJ0(@real[@int]& U) { 
 @real[int] V(U.n)   ,  b= onG .* U;
  b  = onG ? b : Bi ;  
  V = Ai^-1*b;	
  Update(V,U);
  V -= U;   return V; }
\eFF\smallskip
 Where the  parallel \texttt{MPIGMRES} or \texttt{MPICG}  algorithm is just a simple way to solve in 
 parallel the following $A_i x_i = b_i, i = 1, .., N_p$ by just changing the dot product by reduce the local dot product of all process
 with the following MPI code:
\smallskip\bFF
@template<@class R> @R ReduceSum1(@R s,MPI_Comm * comm)
{   @R r=0;
    @MPI@_@Allreduce( &s, &r, 1 ,MPI_TYPE<@R>::TYPE(),   MPI_SUM,  *comm );
    @return r; }
\eFF
This is done in \texttt{MPIGC} dynamics library tool.

We  have all ingredient to solve in parallel if we have et the partitions of the unity.
To build this partition we do:
the initial step 
on process $1$ tp 
build a coarse mesh, $\Th^*$ of the full domain,
and build the partition $\pi$  function constant equal to $i$ on each 
sub domain $\mathcal{O}_i, i =1 ,.., N_p$,  of the grid with the \texttt{Metis} graph  partitioner  \cite{metis}
 and on each process $i$ in $1..,N_p$ do 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Broadcast from process $1$, the mesh  $\Th^*$ (call \texttt{Thii} in freefem++ script), and $\pi$ function,
\item remark that the characteristic function  $\1_{\mathcal{O}_i}$ of domain $\mathcal{O}_i$,   is defined  by $(\pi=i) ? 1 : 0 $, 
\item let us call $\Pi^2_P$ (resp. $\Pi^2_V$) the $L^2$ on $P_h^*$ the space of the constant finite element function per element on $\Th^*$ (resp.
$V_h^*$ the space of the affine continuous finite element per element on $\Th^*$).
and build in parallel the  $\pi_i$ and $\Omega_i$, such that   $ \mathcal{O}_i\ \subset \Omega_i$  where
 $ \mathcal{O}_i= supp ( (\Pi^2_V \Pi^2_C)^m \1_{O_i} )$, 
 and $m$ is a the overlaps size on the coarse mesh (generally one),
 
  (this is done in function \verb!AddLayers(Thii,suppii[],nlayer,phii[]);!
  We choose a function $\pi^*_i = (\Pi^2_1 \Pi^2_0)^m \1_{\mathcal{O}_i}   $ 
 so the partition of the unity is simply defined by
 \begin{equation}
  \pi_i = \frac{\pi_i^*}{\sum_{j=1}^{N_p} \pi_j^*} 
\end{equation}
 The set $J_i$ of  neighborhood of the domain $\Omega_i$, and the local version on $V_{hi}$  can be defined  the array \texttt{jpart} and \texttt{njpart} with:
 \def\piff,#1{$\pi^*_#1$}\smallskip
 \bFF 
      Vhi pii=\piff,i ;  Vhi[int] pij(npij);// local partition of 1 = pii + $\sum_j$ pij[j]  
       
      @int[@int] jpart(npart);   @int njpart=0;
      Vhi sumphi =  \piff,i  ;
      @for (@int i=0;i<@npart;++i)
        @if(i != ipart ) { 
           @if(int3d(Thi)( \piff,j)>0) {             
             pij[njpart]=\piff,j;
             sumphi[] += pij[njpart][]; 
             jpart[njpart++]=i;}}}
           pii[]=pii[] ./ sumphi[];
          @for (int j=0;j<njpart;++j) pij[j][] = pij[j][] ./ sumphi[];
          @jpart.resize(njpart);
 \eFF
\item 
 We call $\Th^*_{ij}$ the sub mesh part of $\Th_i$ where $\pi_j$ are none zero. 
 and tank to the function \texttt{trunc} to build this array,\smallskip
\bFF
       @for(@int jp=0;jp<njpart;++jp)
         aThij[jp]  = trunc(Thi,pij[jp]>1e-10,label=10); 
\eFF\smallskip
%\item we exchange all sub mesh $\Th_{ij}$ of the process $i$ to to all process $j$
%and we call the mesh on process $i$ the mesh $\Th_{ji}$, this part is the most tricky 
%part because we send / receive large  complex data form all to all, with no real order.
%The only way do  that in MPI is to
%make asynchronous  Isend / Irecv with a wait at end otherwise we break all MPI buffer.
%This imply the implementation of this  send/recv/wait
% of meshes (not so simple code), but after this we can write\smallskip
%\bFF
%     @macro  ISendRecvAny(comm,jpart,Si,Ri) { 
%       @int n= jpart.n,nn=n+n;
%       @mpiRequest[int] rq(nn);
%       @for (@int j=0;j<n;++j)
%         Irecv(processor(jpart[j],comm,rq[j]),Ri[j]);
%       @for (@int j=0;j<n;++j)
%         Isend(processor(jpart[j],comm,rq[n+j]),Si[j]);
%       @for (@int j=0;j<nn;++j)
%         mpiWaitAny(rq); }//EndofMacro\hfilll
%         
%     @ISendRecvAny(comm,jpart,aThij,Thij) 
%\eFF
\item At this step we have  all on  the coarse mesh , so we can 
build the fine final mesh by splitting all meshes : \verb!Thi, Thij[j],Thij[j]! 
with freefem++ \texttt{trunc} mesh function which do restriction and slipping. 
\smallskip
\item The construction of the send/recv  matrices  \verb!sMj! and \verb!rMj! :
can done with this code:\smallskip
\bFF
     @mesh3 Thij=Thi; // variable meshes 
     @fespace Whij(Thij,Pk);// variable fespace .. 
     @matrix Pii; Whi wpii=pii; Pii = wpii[]; // Diagonal matrix corresponding $\times \pi_i$
     @matrix[int] sMj(njpart), rMj(njpart); // M  send/rend case..      
      @for(int jp=0;jp<njpart;++jp)
        { @int j=jpart[jp];
          Thij = aThij[jp];//change mesh to change Whij,Whij
          @matrix I = interpolate(Whij,Whi); // Whij <- Whi
          sMj[jp] = I*Pii;  // Whi -> s Whij  
          rMj[jp] = interpolate(Whij,Whi,t=1); }}  // Whij -> Whi    
\eFF
\end{enumerate}

To buil a not to bad application, I have add code tout change variable from parametre value
with the following code 
\bFF
@include "getARGV.idp"
verbosity=getARGV("-vv",0);
@int vdebug=getARGV("-d",1);
@int ksplit=getARGV("-k",10);
@int nloc = getARGV("-n",25);
@string sff=getARGV("-p,","");
@int gmres=getARGV("-gmres",3); 
@bool dplot=getARGV("-dp",0);
@int nC = getARGV("-N" ,max(nloc/10,4)); 
\eFF
%%\include{docFFGUI}

 And  small include to make graphic in parallel
of distribute solution of vector $u$ on mesh $T_h$
with the following interface:
\bFF
@include "MPIplot.idp"
@func bool  plotMPIall(mesh &Th,real[int] & u,string  cm)
{ PLOTMPIALL(mesh,Pk, Th, u,{ cmm=cm,nbiso=20,fill=1,dim=3,value=1}); return 1;}
\eFF
remark the \verb!{cmm=cm,  ... =1}! in the macro argument is a way to quote macro argument \index{macro!quote}
so the argument is \verb!cmm=cm,  ... =1!.


\section{Parallel sparse solvers}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Parallel sparse solvers use several processors to solve linear systems of equation. Like  sequential,
parallel linear solvers can be direct or iterative. In \freefempp both are available.

\subsection{Using  parallel sparse solvers in \freefempp}
We recall that the \texttt{solver} parameters are defined in the following commands: \texttt{solve}, \texttt{problem}, \texttt{set} (setting parameter  of a matrix)
and in the construction of the matrix corresponding to a bilinear form. In these commands, the parameter \texttt{solver} must be set to \texttt{sparsesolver}
for parallel sparse solver. We have added specify parameters to these command lines for parallel sparse solvers. These are
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{lparams:}   vector of integer parameters  (l is for the c++ type long)
\item \texttt{dparams:}  vector of real parameters
\item \texttt{sparams:}  string parameters
\item \texttt{datafilename:}  name of the file which contains solver parameters
\end{itemize}
The following four parameters are only for direct solvers and are vectors. These parameters allow the user to preprocess the matrix
(see the section on sparse direct solver above for more information).
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{permr:}   row permutation (integer vector)
\item \texttt{permc:}  column permutation or inverse row permutation  (integer vector)
\item \texttt{scaler:}   row scaling        (real vector)
\item \texttt{scalec:}  column scaling (real vector)
\end{itemize}

There are two possibilities to control solver parameters. The first method defines parameters with \texttt{lparams},  \texttt{dparams} and  \texttt{sparams} in .edp file.
The second one reads  the solver parameters  from a data file. The name of this file  is specified by \texttt{datafilename}.
If \texttt{lparams},  \texttt{dparams},  \texttt{sparams}  or \texttt{datafilename} is not provided by the user, the solver's default value is used.
\\\\
To use  parallel solver in \freefempp, we need to load the dynamic library corresponding to this solver. For example to use
 MUMPS solver as parallel solver in FreeFem, write in the .edp file {\bf{load "MUMPS\_FreeFem"}}.

If the libraries are not loaded, the default sparse solver will be loaded (default sparse solver is UMFPACK). The table \ref{lib.sparse.solver} gives this new value for the different libraries.

\begin{table}[ht!]
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline
                                  & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{default sparse solver }  \\

parms\_FreeFem   & parms & previous solver \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Default sparse solver for real and complex arithmetics when we load a parallel sparse solver library \label{lib.sparse.solver}}
\end{table}

We also add functions (see Table  \ref{func.sparse.solver}) with no parameter to change the default sparse solver in the .edp file. To use these functions, we need to load the library corresponding to the solver. An example of using different parallel sparse solvers for the same problem is given in testdirectsolvers.edp (directory example$++-$mpi).

\begin{table}[ht!]
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline

\subsection{Sparse direct solver}

In this section, we present the sparse direct solvers interfaced with \freefempp .

\subsubsection{MUMPS solver}
\label{sectionmumps}

MUltifrontal Massively Parallel Solver (MUMPS) is a free library \cite{mumpspubl1,mumpspubl2,mumpspubl3}. This package solves linear system of the form $A \: x = b$ where
$A$ is a square sparse matrix with a direct method. The square matrix considered in MUMPS can be either unsymmetric, symmetric positive definite or general symmetric.
The method implemented in MUMPS is  a direct method based on a multifrontal approach \cite{mumpspubl1}. It constructs a direct factorization
$A \:= \: L\:U$, $A\: = \: L^t \: D \: L$ depending of the symmetry of the matrix $A$. MUMPS uses the following libraries : BLAS\cite{blas1,blas2}, BLACS and ScaLAPACK\cite{scalapackuserguide}.

\begin{remark} MUMPS does not solve linear system with a rectangular matrix.\\
\end{remark}

\begin{paragraph}
{\bf{Installation of MUMPS}}
To used MUMPS in \freefempp, you have to install the MUMPS package into your computer.
MUMPS is written in Fortran 90. The parallel version is constructed using MPI \cite{mpi} for message passing and BLAS \cite{blas1,blas2},
BLACS and ScaLAPACK\cite{scalapackuserguide}. Therefore, a fortran compiler is needed, and MPI, BLAS, BLACS and ScaLAPACK . An installation
procedure to obtain this package is given in the file README\_COMPILE in the directory src/solver of \freefempp.
\end{paragraph}

\begin{paragraph}
{\bf{Creating Library of MUMPS interface for \freefempp:}}  The MUMPS interface for \freefempp is given in file MUMPS\_freefem.cpp (directory src/solver/ ).
This interface works with the release 3.8.3 and 3.8.4 of MUMPS.  To used MUMPS in \freefempp, we need the library corresponding to this interface.
A description to obtain this library is given in the file README\_COMPILE in the directory src/solver of \freefempp. We recall here the procedure. Go to the directory src/solver in \freefempp package. Edit the file makefile-sparsesolver.inc to yours
system: comment Section 1, comment line corresponding to libraries BLAS, BLACS, ScaLAPACK, Metis, scotch in Section 2 and comment in Section 3
the paragraph corresponding to MUMPS solver. And then type {\bf{make mumps}} in a terminal window.
\end{paragraph}


%%\begin{paragraph}

%%\end{paragraph}

Now we give a short description of MUMPS parameters before describing the method to call MUMPS in \freefempp.

\begin{paragraph}
{\bf{MUMPS parameters:} } There are four input parameters in MUMPS (see \cite{mumpsuserguide}). Two integers SYM and PAR, a vector of integer of size 40 INCTL and a vector of real of size 15 CNTL.
The first parameter gives the type of the matrix:  0 for unsymmetric matrix, 1 for symmetric positive matrix and 2 for general symmetric. The second parameter defined
if the host processor work during the factorization and solves steps : PAR=1 host processor working and PAR=0 host processor not working.
The parameter INCTL and CNTL  is the control parameter of MUMPS. The vectors ICNTL and CNTL in MUMPS becomes with index 1 like vector in fortran.  A short description of all parameters of ICNTL and CNTL is given in ffmumps\_fileparam.txt. For more details see the users' guide \cite{mumpsuserguide}. 

We describe now some elements of the main parameters of ICNTL for MUMPS. \\

\hspace*{0.5cm}{\bf{Input matrix parameter}} The input matrix is controlled by parameters ICNTL(5) and ICNTL(18).  The matrix format (resp. matrix pattern and matrix entries)
are controlled by INCTL(5) (resp. INCTL(18)).  The different values of ICNTL(5) are 0 for assembled format and 1 for element format.
%They con are respectively matrix format (0: assembled format and 1: elemental format) and matrix pattern and matrix entries.
In the current release of Freefem$++$, we consider that FE matrix or matrix is storage in assembled format. Therefore, INCTL(5) is treated as 0 value.
The main option for ICNTL(18):  INCLTL(18)=0  centrally on the host processor, ICNTL(18)=3 distributed the input matrix pattern and the entries
(recommended option for distributed matrix by developer of MUMPS). For other values of ICNTL(18) see the user's guide of MUMPS. These values can be used also in Freefem++.

The default option implemented in \freefempp are ICNTL(5)=0 and ICNTL(18)=0.\\

\hspace*{0.5cm}{\bf{Preprocessing parameter}} The preprocessed matrix $A_{p}$ that will be effectively factored is defined by
$$
A_{p} = P \: D_r \: A \: Q_c \ D_c  P^t
$$
where $P$ is the permutation matrix, $Q_c$ is the column permutation, $D_r$ and $D_c$ are diagonal matrix for respectively row and column scaling.
The ordering strategy to obtain $P$ is controlled by parameter ICNTL(7). The permutation of zero free diagonal $Q_c$ is controlled by parameter ICNTL(6).
The row and column scaling is controlled by parameter ICNTL(18). These option are connected and also strongly related with ICNTL(12) (see documentation of mumps
for more details  \cite{mumpsuserguide}).  The parameters permr, scaler, and scalec in \freefempp allow to give permutation matrix($P$), row scaling ($D_r$) and column scaling ($D_c$) of the user respectively.

%%Automatic choice decision strategy for these parameters is given by MUMPS.
%%  All ordering strategy required is download and compile automatically by Freefem++ during installation phase of Freefem++.

\paragraph{Calling MUMPS in FreeFem++}

To call MUMPS in \freefempp, we need to load the dynamic library MUMPS\_freefem.dylib (MacOSX),  MUMPS\_freefem.so (Unix) or  MUMPS\_freefem.dll (Windows).
This is  done in typing load "MUMPS\_freefem" in the .edp file. We give now the two methods to give the option of MUMPS solver in \freefempp.

\vspace*{0.5cm}

\hspace*{0.5cm}{\bf{Solver parameters is defined in .edp file:}}
In this method,  we need to give the parameters \texttt{lparams} and \texttt{dparams}. These parameters are defined for MUMPS by \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
&lparams[0] = SYM, \\
&lparams[1] = PAR,  \\
$\forall i=1,\ldots,40, \quad$ & lparams[$i$+1] = ICNTL($i$).\\
\\
$\forall i=1,\ldots,15, \quad$ & dparams[$i-1$] = CNTL($i$).
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace*{0.5cm}

\hspace*{0.5cm}{\bf{Reading solver parameters on a file:}}
The structure of data file for MUMPS in \freefempp is : first line parameter SYM and second line parameter PAR and in the following line the different value of vectors ICNTL and CNTL. An example of this parameter file is given in \texttt{ffmumpsfileparam.txt}. \\

\eFF

If no solver parameter is given, we used default option of MUMPS solver.

\begin{paragraph}{\bf{example}}
A simple example of calling MUMPS in \freefempp with this two methods is given in the file testsolver\_MUMPS.edp in the directory examples++-mpi.
\end{paragraph}

\subsubsection{SuperLU distributed solver}
\label{sectionsuperludist}

The package SuperLU\_DIST \cite{slu2,slu1}  solves linear systems using LU factorization. It is a free scientific library under BSD license. The web site of this project is
http://crd.lbl.gov/$\sim$xiaoye/SuperLU. This library provides functions to handle square or rectangular matrix in real and complex arithmetics. The method implemented
in SuperLU\_DIST is a supernodal method \cite{slu1}. New release of this package includes a parallel symbolic factorization \cite{slu2}. This scientific library is written
in C and MPI for communications.


\begin{paragraph}
{\bf{Installation of SuperLU\_DIST:}}
To use SuperLU\_DIST in \freefempp, you have to install SuperLU\_DIST package. We need MPI and ParMetis library to do this compilation. An installation procedure to obtain this package is given in the file README\_COMPILE in the directory src/solver/  of the freefem++ package.
%To used SuperLU distributed, we first need to compile this libraries. The file  *.a  and *.h  must be copied in the tree of freefem$++$ respectively in directory /download/lib/ and directory /download/include/.
%To compile  SuperLU Distributed during the compilation of freefem$++$, we must used  the option --enable-download at the configure step. %% futur release
\end{paragraph}

\begin{paragraph}
{\bf{Creating Library of SuperLU\_DIST interface for \freefempp:}}
The \freefempp interface to SuperLU\_DIST for real (resp. complex) arithmetics is given in file \\
real\_SuperLU\_DIST\_FreeFem.cpp (resp. complex\_SuperLU\_DIST\_FreeFem.cpp). These files  are in the directory src/solver/.  These interfaces are compatible with the release 3.2.1 of SuperLU\_DIST. To use SuperLU\_DIST in \freefempp, we need libraries corresponding to these interfaces. A description to obtain these libraries is given in the file README\_COMPILE in the directory
src/solver of \freefempp. We recall here the procedure. Go to the directory src/solver in \freefempp package. Edit the file makefile-sparsesolver.inc in your system : comment Section 1, comment line corresponding to libraries BLAS, Metis, ParMetis in Section 2 and comment in Section 3 the paragraph corresponding to SuperLU\_DIST solver. And just type {\bf{make rsludist}} (resp. {\bf{make csludist}})  in the terminal to obtain the dynamic library of interface for real (resp. complex) arithmetics.
\end{paragraph}

Now we give a short description of SuperLU\_DIST parameters before describing the method to call SuperLU\_DIST in \freefempp.

\begin{paragraph}
{\bf{SuperLU\_DIST parameters: }}

We describe now some parameters of SuperLU\_DIST. The SuperLU\_DIST library use a 2D-logical process group. This process grid is specifies by $nprow$ (process row) and $npcol$ (process column) such that $N_{p} = nprow \: npcol$ where $N_{p}$ is the number of all process allocated for SuperLU\_DIST.

The input matrix parameters is controlled by  "matrix= " in  sparams for internal parameter or in the third line of parameters file. The different value are\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
matrix = assembled            & global matrix are available on all process \\
matrix = distributedglobal  & the global matrix is distributed among all the process \\
 matrix = distributed            & the input matrix is distributed (not yet implemented) \\
\end{tabular}

The option arguments of SuperLU\_DIST are described in the section Users-callable routine of \cite{sluuserguide}. The parameter Fact and TRANS are specified in \freefempp interfaces to SuperLU\_DIST during the different steps. For this reason, the value given by the user for this option is not considered.

The factorization LU is calculated in SuperLU\_DIST on the matrix $A_p$.
$$
A_{p} =  P_{c} \:  P_r \: D_r \: A \: D_{c} \: P_{c}^{t}
$$
where $P_c$ and $P_r$ is the row and column permutation matrix respectively, $D_r$ and $D_c$ are diagonal matrix for respectively row and column scaling.
The option argument RowPerm (resp. ColPerm) control the row (resp. column) permutation matrix.  $D_r$ and $D_c$ is controlled by the parameter DiagScale.
The parameter permr, permc, scaler, and scalec in \freefempp is provided to give row permutation, column permutation, row scaling and column scaling of the user respectively.
The other parameters for LU factorization are ParSymFact and ReplaceTinyPivot.  The parallel symbolic factorization works only on a power of two processes and
need the ParMetis ordering \cite{parmetis}. The default option argument of SuperLU\_DIST are given in the file ffsuperlu\_dist\_fileparam.txt.
\end{paragraph}

\paragraph{Calling SuperLU\_DIST in FreeFem++}

To call SuperLU\_DIST in \freefempp, we need to load the library dynamic correspond to interface.
This done by the following line  {\bf{load "real\_superlu \_DIST\_FreeFem"}} (resp.  {\bf{load "complex\_superlu\_DIST\_FreeFem"}}) for real (resp. complex) arithmetics in the file .edp.

\vspace*{0.5cm}

\paragraph{Solver parameters is defined in .edp file:}
To call SuperLU\_DIST with internal parameter, we used the parameters sparams. The value of parameters of SuperLU\_DIST in sparams is defined by\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
sparams&="nprow=1, npcol=1, matrix= distributedgloba, Fact= DOFACT, Equil=NO, \\
	      & ParSymbFact=NO, ColPerm= MMD\_AT\_PLUS\_A, RowPerm= LargeDiag, \\
	      & DiagPivotThresh=1.0, IterRefine=DOUBLE, Trans=NOTRANS, \\
	      & ReplaceTinyPivot=NO, SolveInitialized=NO, PrintStat=NO, DiagScale=NOEQUIL "
\end{tabular}	
This value correspond to the parameter in the file ffsuperlu\_dist\_fileparam.txt. If one parameter is not specify by the user, we take the default value of SuperLU\_DIST.

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\paragraph{Reading solver parameters on a file:}
The structure of data file for SuperLU\_DIST  in \freefempp is given in the file
ffsuperlu\_dist\_fileparam.txt  (default value of the \freefempp interface).
\bFF
1                               /* nprow : integer value     */

1.0                           /* DiagPivotThresh : real value */
DOUBLE                  /* IterRefine : NOREFINE, SINGLE, DOUBLE, EXTRA */
NOTRANS               /* Trans      : NOTRANS, TRANS, CONJ*/
NO                           /* ReplaceTinyPivot  : NO, YES*/

NOEQUIL                 /* DiagScale : NOEQUIL, ROW, COL, BOTH*/
\eFF

If no solver parameter is given, we used default option of SuperLU\_DIST  solver.

\begin{example}
A simple example of calling SuperLU\_DIST in \freefempp with this two methods is given in the file testsolver\_superLU\_DIST.edp in the directory examples++-mpi.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Pastix solver}
\label{sectionpastix}

Pastix (Parallel Sparse matrix package) is a free scientific library under CECILL-C license. This package solves sparse linear system with a direct and block ILU(k) iterative methods. This solver can be applied to a real or complex matrix with a symmetric pattern \cite{pastix}.

\begin{paragraph}
{\bf{Installation of Pastix:}}
To used Pastix in \freefempp, you have to install pastix package in first. To compile this package, we need a fortran 90 compiler, scotch \cite{scotch} or Metis \cite{metis}
ordering library and MPI. An installation procedure to obtain this package is given in the file .src/solver/ README\_COMPILE in the section pastix of the \freefempp package.
%or in the webpage .
\end{paragraph}

\begin{paragraph}
{\bf{Creating Library of pastix interface for \freefempp:}}
The \freefempp interface to pastix is given in file real\_pastix\_FreeFem.cpp (resp. complex\_pastix\_FreeFem.cpp) for real (resp.complex) arithmetics. This interface is compatible with the release 2200 of pastix and is designed for a global matrix. We have also implemented interface for distributed matrices.   To use pastix in \freefempp, we need the library corresponding
to this interface. A description to obtain this library is given in the file README\_COMPILE in the directory src/solver of \freefempp. We recall here the procedure. Go to the
directory src/solver in \freefempp package. Edit the file makefile-sparsesolver.inc to yours system : comment Section 1, comment line corresponding to libraries BLAS, METIS and
SCOTCH in Section 2 and comment in Section 3 the paragraph corresponding to pastix solver. And just type {\bf{make rpastix}} (resp. {\bf{make cpastix}}) in the terminal to obtain the dynamic library of interface for real (resp. complex) arithmetics.
\end{paragraph}

Now we give a short description of pastix parameters before describing the method to call pastix in \freefempp.

\begin{paragraph}
{\bf{Pastix parameters: }}
The input {\texttt{matrix}} parameter of \freefempp depend on pastix interface.  {\texttt{matrix}}=assembled for non distributed matrix.  It is the same parameter for SuperLU\_DIST. There are four parameters in Pastix : iparm, dparm, perm and invp. These parameters are respectively the integer parameters (vector of size 64),
real parameters (vector of size 64), permutation matrix and inverse permutation matrix respectively. iparm and dparm vectors are described in \cite{pastixrefcard}.
The parameters permr and permc in \freefempp are provided to give permutation matrix and inverse permutation matrix  of the user respectively.
\end{paragraph}

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\paragraph{Solver parameters defined in .edp file:}
To call Pastix in \freefempp in this case, we need to specify the parameters {\bf{lparams}} and {\bf{dparams}}. These parameters are defined by \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\forall i=0,\ldots,63, \quad$ & lparams[$i$] = iparm[$i$].\\
\\
$\forall i=0,\ldots,63, \quad$ & dparams[$i$] = dparm[$i$].
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\paragraph{Reading solver parameters on a file:}
The structure of data file for pastix parameters in \freefempp is :  first line structure parameters of the matrix and in the following line the value of vectors iparm and dparm in this order.
\bFF
assembled  /* matrix input :: assembled, distributed global and distributed */
iparm[0]
iparm[1]
\ldots
\ldots
iparm[63]

\eFF
An example of this file parameter is given in ffpastix\_iparm\_dparm.txt with a description of these parameters. This file is obtained with the example file iparm.txt and
dparm.txt including in the pastix package. \\

If no solver parameter is given, we use the default option of pastix solver.

\subsection{Parallel sparse iterative solver}


Concerning  \textbf{ iterative solvers}, we have chosen
\textit{pARMS} \cite{spARMS} , \textit{HIPS} \cite{HIPS} and  \textit{Hypre}
\cite{HYPRE}.
Each software implements a different type of parallel preconditioner.
So, \textit{pARMS} implements algebraic domain decomposition preconditioner type
such as additive Schwartz \cite{CAI89}
 and  interface method \cite{LISAAD}; while HIPS implement hierarchical
incomplete factorization \cite{A:LaBRI::sisc06}
 and finally HYPRE implements multilevel preconditioner are AMG(Algebraic
MultiGrid)
\cite{A:AMG::sisc00} and parallel approximated inverse \cite{A:PASA::sisc00}.
\\\\
To use one of these programs in FreeFem++, you have to install it independently
of FreeFem++.
It is also necessary to install the MPI communication library which is essential
for communication
between the processors and, in some cases, software partitioning graphs like
METIS \cite{metis} or Scotch \cite{scotch}.

All this preconditioners are used with Krylov subspace methods accelerators.
Krylov subspace methods are iterative methods
which consist in finding a solution $x$ of linear system $Ax=b$ inside the
affine space $x_0+K_m$ by imposing that $b-Ax \bot \mathcal{L}_m$, where $K_m$
is Krylov subspace of dimension $m$ defined by $K_m=\{r_0, Ar_0,
A^2r_0,...,A^{m-1}r_0\}$ and $\mathcal{L}_m$ is another subspace of dimension
$m$ which depends on type of Krylov subspace. For example in GMRES,
$\mathcal{L}_m=AK_m$.
\\\\
We realized an interface which is easy to use, so that the call of these
different softwares in FreeFem++ is done in the same way.
You just have to load the solver and then specify the parameters to  apply to
the specific  solvers. In the rest of this chapter,
when  we talk about Krylov subspace methods we mean one among  GMRES, CG and
BICGSTAB.

\subsubsection{pARMS solver}
\label{sectionparms}
\textbf{pARMS} ( \textit{parallel Algebraic Multilevel Solver})
is a software developed by Youssef Saad and al at University of
 Minnesota \cite{spARMS}.
This software is specialized in the resolution of large sparse non symmetric
linear systems of equation. Solvers developed in pARMS is the Krylov subspace
type.
It consists of variants of GMRES like FGMRES(Flexible GMRES)  , DGMRES(Deflated
GMRES) \cite{SAAD03} and  BICGSTAB.
pARMS also implements parallel preconditioner like RAS (Restricted Additive
Schwarz)\cite{CAI89}
and Schur Complement type preconditioner \cite{LISAAD}.



All these  parallel preconditioners are based on the principle of domain
decomposition.
Thus, the matrix $A$ is partitioned into sub matrices $A_i$($i=1,...,p$) where
p represents the number of partitions one needs.
The union of $A_i$ forms the original matrix.
The solution of the overall system is obtained by solving the local systems on
$A_i$ (see \cite{Smith96}).
Therefore, a distinction is made between iterations on $A$ and the local
iterations on $A_i$.
To solve the local problem on $A_i$ there are several preconditioners as
\textbf{ilut} (Incomplete  LU with threshold),
\textbf{iluk}(Incomplete  LU with level of fill in) and \textbf{ARMS}( Algebraic
Recursive Multilevel Solver). But to use pAMRS in
FreeFem++ you have first to install pAMRS.

\paragraph*{Installation of pARMS}
To install pARMS, you must first download  the pARMS package at \cite{spARMS}.
Once the download is complete, you must unpack package pARMS and follow the
installation procedure
described in file README to create the library \textbf{libparms.a}.

\paragraph*{Using pARMS as interface to FreeFem++}
Before calling pARMS solver inside FreeFem++, you must
compile file $parms\_FreeFem.cpp$  to create a dynamic library
$parms\_FreeFem.so$.
To do this, move to the directory $src/solver$ of  FreeFem++, edit the file
$makefile\-parms.inc$ to specify the following variables:\\

\begin{tabular}{ll}
 %\begin{tabular*}
$PARMS\_DIR$ : &  Directory of pARMS \\
\textbf{$PARMS\_INCLUDE$} : &  Directory for header of pARMS \\
\textbf{$METIS$}   : &    METIS directory  \\
\textbf{$METIS\_LIB$} : &    METIS librairy \\
\textbf{$MPI$} : & MPI directory  \\
\textbf{$MPI\_INCLUDE$} : & MPI headers \\
\textbf{$FREEFEM$} : &  FreeFem++ directory \\
\textbf{$FREEFEM\_INCLUDE$} : &  FreeFem++ header for sparse linear solver\\
\textbf{$LIBBLAS$} : & Blas library\\
\end{tabular}

After  that, in the command line  type \textbf{make parms} to create
$parms\_FreeFem.so$.
\\
As usual in FreeFem++, we will show by examples how to call pARMS in FreeFem++.
There are three ways of doing this:
\paragraph*{Example 1: Default parameters }
This example comes from user guide of FreeFem++ \cite{ufreefem} at page 12.
\begin{example}\label{exm:first}~
\bFF
 1: @load parms_freefem   // Tell FreeFem that you will use pARMS 
 2: @border C(t=0,2*@pi){@x=cos(t); @y=sin(t);label=1;}
 3: @mesh Th = @buildmesh (C(50));
 4: @fespace Vh(Th,@P2);
 5: Vh u,v;
 6: @func f= x*y;
 7: @problem Poisson(u,v,@solver=sparsesolver) =   //  bilinear part will use 
 8:    @int2d(Th)(@dx(u)*@dx(v) + @dy(u)*@dy(v))  //  a sparse solver, in this case pARMS
 9:    - @int2d(Th)( f*v)          // right hand side
10:    + @on(1,u=0)  ;  // Dirichlet boundary condition
11:
12: @real cpu=clock();
13: Poisson; // SOLVE THE PDE
14: @plot(u);
15: @cout << " CPU time = " << clock()-cpu << @endl;
\eFF
\end{example}

In line 1 of example \ref{exm:first} we load in memory the pARMS dynamic library
with interface FreeFem++.
After this, in line 7 we specify that the bilinear form will be solved by the
last sparse linear solver
load in memory which, in this case, is pARMS.


The parameter used in pARMS in this case is the default one since the user does
not have to provide any parameter.

 Here are some default parameters:\\
\textbf{solver}=FGMRES, \textbf{Krylov dimension}=30, \textbf{Maximum of
Krylov}=1000,
\textbf{Tolerance for convergence}=$1e-08$.(see book of Saad \cite{SAAD03} to
understand all this parameters.) \\
\textbf{preconditionner}=Restricted Additif Schwarz \cite{CAI89}, \textbf{Inner
Krylov dimension}=5,
\textbf{Maximum of inner Krylov dimension}=5, \textbf{Inner
preconditionner}=ILUK.
\\\\
To specify the parameters to apply to the solver, the user can either give an
integer
vector for \textbf{integer parameters} and real vectors for \textbf{real
parameters} or provide a \textbf{file} which contains those parameters.
\paragraph*{Example 2: User specifies parameters inside two
vectors}\label{vecparms}
Lets us consider Navier Stokes example \ref{exm:segond} . In this example we
solve linear systems coming from discretization
of Navier Stokes equation with pARMS. Parameters of solver is specified by
user.

\begin{example}[Stokes.edp]\label{exm:segond}
\bFF
include "manual.edp"
include "includes.edp";
include "mesh_with_cylinder.edp";
include "bc_poiseuille_in_square.edp";
include "fe_functions.edp";
0: load parms_FreeFem
1: @int[int] iparm(16); real[int] dparm(6);
2: @int ,ii;
3: @for(ii=0;ii<16;ii++){iparm[ii]=-1;}  for(ii=0;ii<6;ii++) dparm[ii]=-1.0;
4: @fespace Vh(Th,[P2,P2,P1]);
5: @iparm[0]=0;
6: @varf Stokes ([u,v,p],[ush,vsh,psh],\textbf{solver=sparsesolver}) =
 int2d(Th)( nu*( dx(u)*dx(ush) + dy(u)*dy(ush) + dx(v)*dx(vsh) + dy(v)*dy(vsh) )
            - p*psh*(1.e-6)          			         // p epsilon
            - p*(dx(ush)+dy(vsh))   //+ dx(p)*ush + dy(p)*vsh
            - (dx(u)+dy(v))*psh                        	 // psh div(u)
  )
 + on(cylinder,infwall,supwall,u=0.,v=0.)+on(inlet,u=uc,v=0);    // Bdy conditions
7: @matrix AA=Stokes(VVh,VVh);
8: @set(AA,solver=sparsesolver,lparams=iparm,dparams=dparm); //Set pARMS as linear solver
9: @real[int] bb= Stokes(0,VVh); real[int] sol(AA.n);
10: @sol= AA^-1 * bb;
\eFF
\end{example}
We need two vectors to specify the parameters of the linear solver. In line 1 of
example \ref{exm:segond}
we have declared these vectors(\textbf{int[int] iparm(16); real[int] dparm(6);})
. In line 3 we have initialized these  vectors by
negative values. We do this because all parameters values in pARMS are positive
and if you do not change the negative values of
one entry of this vector, the default value will be set.
In tables (table \ref{lpparm} and \ref{pardoubleparm}) , we have the meaning  of
differents entries of these vectors.

In this example, we fix the matrix size (in term of finite element, we fix the
mesh) and increase the number of processors
used to solve the linear system. We saw that, when the number of processors
increases, the time for solving the linear equation decreases, even if the
number of iteration increases. This proves that, using pARMS as solver of linear
systems coming from discretization of partial differential equation in FreeFem++
can decrease drastically the total time of simulation.

\subsubsection{Interfacing with HIPS}
\textbf{HIPS} ( \textit{Hierarchical  Iterative Parallel Solver}) is a scientific
library
that provides an efficient parallel iterative solver for very large sparse
linear systems.
HIPS is available as free software under the CeCILL-C licence.
The interface that we realized  is compatible with release \textbf{1.2 beta.rc4}
 of HIPS.

HIPS implements two solver classes which are the iteratives class ( GMRES,  PCG)
and  the Direct class.
Concerning preconditionners, HIPS implements a type of multilevel ILU.
For further informations on those preconditionners see \cite{A:LaBRI::sisc06,
A:LaBRI::HRR07}.
\paragraph*{Installation of HIPS}
To install HIPS, first download the HIPS package at \cite{HIPS}, unpack it and
go to the HIPS source directory.
The installation of HIPS is machine dependence.
For example, to install HIPS on a  linux cluster copy the file
\textbf{$Makefile\_Inc\_Examples/makefile.inc.gnu$} on the root
 directory of HIPS with the name \textbf{makefile.inc}. After this,
edit \textbf{makefile.inc} to set values of different variables and type
\textbf{make all}.

\paragraph*{Using HIPS as the interface to FreeFem++}
Before calling the HIPS solver inside FreeFem++, you must
compile file $hips\_FreeFem.cpp$  to create dynamic library $hips\_FreeFem.so$.
To do this, move to the directory $src/solver$ of  FreeFem++ and edit the file
$makefile.inc$ to specify the following variables:\\

\begin{tabular}{ll}
 %\begin{tabular*}
\textbf{$HIPS\_DIR$} :   &   Directory of HIPS \\
\textbf{$HIPS\_INCLUDE$}:  & -I\$($HIPS\_DIR$)/SRC/INCLUDE : Directory for HIPS
headers\\
\textbf{$LIB\_DIR$} : & -L\$($HIPS\_DIR$)/LIB : Librairies directory \\
\textbf{$LIBHIPSSEQUENTIAL$} : & \$($HIPS\_DIR$)/LIB/libhipssequential.a: HIPS
utilities library\\
\textbf{$LIBHIPS$}           : & \$($HIPS\_DIR$)/LIB/libhips.a: HIPS library\\
\textbf{$FREEFEM$} : &  FreeFem++ directory \\
\textbf{$FREEFEM\_INCLUDE$} : &  FreeFem headers for sparse linear solver\\
\textbf{$METIS$}   : &    METIS directory  \\
\textbf{$METIS\_LIB$} : &    METIS library \\
\textbf{$MPI$} : & MPI directory  \\
\textbf{$MPI\_INCLUDE$} : & MPI headers \\
\end{tabular}

After  specifies all the variables, in the command line in the directory
$src/solver$ type \textbf{make hips} to create $hips\_FreeFem.so$.
\\
Like with pARMS, the calling of HIPS in FreeFem++ can be done in three different
manners.
We will present only one example where the user specifies the parameters through
keywords \texttt{lparams} and \texttt{dparams}.

\paragraph*{Laplacian 3D solve with HIPS}\label{hipsexample2}
Let us consider the 3D Laplacian  example inside FreeFem++ package where after
discretization we want to solve the linear equation with Hips. Example
\ref{hips:laplacian} is Laplacian3D using Hips as linear solver. We first load
Hips solver at  line 2. From line 4 to 15 we specify the parameters for the Hips
solver and in line 46 of example \ref{hips:laplacian} we set these parameters in
the linear solver.

In Table \ref{hipslabel} results of running example \ref{hips:laplacian} on
Cluster Paradent of Grid5000 are  reported. We can see in this running example
the efficiency of parallelism.

\subsubsection{Interfacing with HYPRE}
\textbf{HYPRE} ( \textit{High Level Preconditioner}) is a suite of parallel
preconditioner developed at
 Lawrence Livermore National Lab \cite{HYPRE} .

There are two main classes of preconditioners developed in HYPRE: AMG
(Algebraic MultiGrid) and Parasails (Parallel Sparse Approximate
Inverse).

Now, suppose we want to solve $Ax=b$.
At the heart of AMG there is a series of progressively coarser(smaller)
representations of the matrix $A$. Given an approximation
$\hat{x}$ to the solution $x$, consider solving the residual equation $Ae=r$ to
find the error $e$, where $r=b-A\hat{x}$.
A fundamental principle of AMG is that it is an algebraically smooth error. To
reduce the algebraically smooth errors further, they
need to be represented by a smaller defect equation (coarse grid residual
equation) $A_ce_c=r_c$, which is cheaper to solve.
After solving this coarse equation, the solution is then interpolated in fine
grid represented here by matrix $A$. The quality of
AMG depends on the choice of coarsening and interpolating operators.

The \textit{sparse approximate inverse } approximates the inverse of a matrix
$A$ by a sparse matrix $M$. A technical idea to
construct matrix $M$ is to minimize the Frobenuis norm of the residual matrix
$I-MA$. For more details on this preconditioner
technics see \cite{chow}.

HYPRE implement three Krylov subspace solvers:  GMRES,  PCG and BiCGStab.

\paragraph{Installation of HYPRE}
To install HYPRE, first download the HYPRE package at \cite{HYPRE}, unpack it
and go to the HYPRE/src source directory and do
\textbf{./configure} to configure Hypre. After this just type \textit{make all}
to create \textbf{libHYPRE.a}.
\paragraph*{Using HYPRE as interface to FreeFem++}
Before calling HYPRE solver inside \freefempp, you must
compile the file $hypre\_FreeFem.cpp$  to create dynamic library
$hypre\_FreeFem.so$.
To do this, move to the directory $src/solver$ of  \freefempp, edit the file
$makefile.inc$ to specify the following variables:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 %\begin{tabular*}
\textbf{$HYPRE\_DIR$} :   &   Directory of HYPRE \\
\multirow{2}{*} \textbf{$HYPRE\_INCLUDE$} = &
-I\$($HYPRE\_DIR$)src/hypre/include/ :\\
& Directory for header of HYPRE\\
\textbf{$HYPRE\_LIB$} = & -L\$($HIPS\_DIR$)/src/lib/ -lHYPRE : Hypre Library \\
\textbf{$FREEFEM$} : &  \freefempp directory \\
\textbf{$FREEFEM\_INCLUDE$} : &  FreeFem header for sparse linear solver\\
\textbf{$METIS$}   : &    METIS directory  \\
\textbf{$METIS\_LIB$} : &    METIS library \\
\textbf{$MPI$} : & MPI directory  \\
\textbf{$MPI\_INCLUDE$} : & MPI headers \\
\end{tabular}


Like with pARMS, the calling of HIPS in \freefempp can be done in three manners.
We will present only one example where the user specifies its parameters through
keywords \texttt{lparams} and \texttt{dparams}.

\paragraph*{Laplacian 3D solve with HYPRE}\label{hypreexample2}
Let us consider again the 3D Laplacian  example inside \freefempp package where
after discretization we want to solve the linear equation with Hypre. Example
\ref{hypre:laplacian} is the Laplacian3D using Hypre as linear solver.
Example \ref{hypre:laplacian} is the same as \ref{hips:laplacian}, so we just
show here the lines where we set some Hypre parameters.

We first load the Hypre solver at line 2. From line 4 to 15 we specifies the
parameters to set to Hypre solver and in line 43
we set parameters to Hypre solver.

 It should be noted that the meaning
of the entries of these vectors is different from those of Hips .
In the case of HYPRE, the meaning of differents entries of vectors
\textbf{iparm} and \textbf{dparm} are given in tables \ref{communipramsHypre} to
\ref{AMGHypre}.\\

In Table \ref{hyprelabel} the results of running example \ref{hypre:laplacian}
on Cluster Paradent of Grid5000 are  reported. We can see in this running
example the efficiency of parallelism, in particular when AMG are use as
preconditioner.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
With the different runs presented here, we wanted to illustrate the gain in time
when we increase the number of processors used for the simulations. We saw that in
every case the time for the construction of the finite element matrix is constant. This is normal
because until now this phase is sequential in \freefempp. In contrast, phases
for solving the linear system are parallel. We saw on several examples
presented here that when we increase the number of processors, in general we
decrease the time used for solving the linear systems. But this not true in every
case. In several case, when we increase the number of processors the time to
convergence also increases. There are two main reasons for this.
First, the increase of processors can lead to the increase of volume of exchanged
data across processors consequently  increasing the time for solving the linear
systems.

Furthermore, in  decomposition domain type preconditioners, the number of processors
generally corresponds to the number of sub domains. In subdomain methods,
generally when we increase the number of subdomains we decrease convergence
quality of the preconditioner. This can increase the time used for
solving linear equations.

To end this, we should note that good use of the preconditioners interfaced in
\freefempp is empiric, because it is difficult to know what is a good
preconditioner for some type of problems. Although, the efficiency of
preconditioners sometimes depends on how its parameters are set. For
this reason we advise the user to pay attention to  the meaning of the parameters in the
user guide of the iterative solvers interfaced in \freefempp.


\subsection{Domain decomposition}
In the previous section, we saw that the phases to construct a matrix are
sequential. One strategy to construct the matrix in parallel is to divide
geometrically the domain into subdomains. In every subdomain we construct a local
submatrix and after that we assemble every submatrix to form the global matrix.

We can use this technique to solve pde directly in domain $\Omega$. In this case,
in every subdomains you have to define artificial boundary conditions to form
consistent equations in every subdomains. After this, you solve equation in
every subdomains and define a strategy to obtain the global solution.

In terms of parallel programming for \freefempp, with MPI, this means that the user
must be able to divide processors  avaible for computation into subgroups of
processors and also must be able to realize different type of communications in
\freefempp  script. Here is a wrapper of some MPI functions.
\subsubsection{Communicators and groups}
\textbf{Groups}\\
mpiGroup grpe(mpiGroup gp,$KN\_<long>$): Create $MPI\_Group$  from  existing group \textbf{gp} by
given vector \\

\textbf{Communicators}\\
Communicators is an abstract MPI object which allows MPI user to communicate
across group of processors. Communicators can be
Intra\-communicators(involves a single group) or Inter\-communicators (involves
two groups). When we not specify type of communicator it will be Intra\-communicators\\



\textbf{mpiComm cc(mpiComm comm, mpiGroup gp)}: Creates a new communicator.
\textit{comm} communicator(handle), \textit{gp} group which is a subset of the
group of \textit{comm} (handle). Return new communicator  \\

\textbf{mpiComm cc(mpiGroup gp)}: Same as previous constructor but default
\textit{comm} here is MPI\_COMM\_WORLD.

\textbf{mpiComm cc(mpiComm comm, int color, int key)}: Creates new communicators
based on \textit{colors} and \textit{key}. This constructor is based on
MPI\_Comm\_split routine of MPI.


\textbf{mpiComm cc(MPIrank p,int key)}:  Same constructor than the last one.
Here \textit{colors} and \textit{comm} is defined in \textit{MPIrank}. This
constructor is based on MPI\_Comm\_split routine of MPI.
\begin{example}[commsplit.edp]\label{comm:comm}
\bFF
1: @int color=mpiRank(comm)\%2;
2: @mpiComm ccc(processor(color,comm),0);
3: @mpiComm qpp(comm,);
4: @mpiComm cp(cc,color,0);
\eFF
\end{example}

\textbf{mpiComm cc(mpiComm comm, int high)}: Creates an intracommunicator from
an intercommunicator. \textit{comm} intercommunicator,
\textit{high} Used to order the groups within \textit{comm} (logical) when
creating the new communicator. This constructor is based on
MPI\_Intercomm\_merge routine of MPI.

\textbf{mpiComm cc(MPIrank p1, MPIrank p2, int tag)}: This constructor creates
an intercommuncator from two intracommunicators. \textit{p1} defined local
(intra)communicator and rank in local\_comm of leader (often 0) while
\textit{p2}  defined remote communicator and rank in peer\_comm of remote leader
(often 0). \textit{tag} Message tag to use in constructing intercommunicator.
This constructor is based on MPI\_Intercomm\_create.

\begin{example}[merge.edp]\label{merge:comm}
\bFF
1: @mpiComm comm,cc;
2: @int color=mpiRank(comm)\%2;
3: @int rk=mpiRank(comm);
4: @int size=mpiSize(comm);
4: @cout << "Color values " << color << endl;
5: @mpiComm ccc(processor((rk<size/2),comm),rk);
6: @mpiComm cp(cc,color,0);
7: @int rleader;
8: @if (rk == 0) {  rleader = size/2; }
9: @else if (rk == size/2) { rleader = 0;}
10: @else { rleader = 3; }
11: @mpiComm qqp(processor(0,ccc),processor(rleader,comm),12345);
12:@int aaa=mpiSize(ccc);
13:@cout << "number of processor" << aaa << endl;
\eFF
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Process}
In \freefempp we wrap MPI process by function call \textbf{processor} which
create internal \freefempp object call \textbf{MPIrank}. This mean that do not
use \textbf{MPIrank} in \freefempp script.

\textbf{processor(int rk):} Keep process rank inside object \textbf{MPIrank}.
Rank is inside MPI\_COMM\_WORLD.

\textbf{processor(int rk, mpiComm cc) and processor(mpiComm cc,int rk) } process
rank inside communicator cc.

\textbf{processor(int rk, mpiComm cc) and processor(mpiComm cc,int rk) } process
rank inside communicator cc.

\textbf{processorblock(int rk) }: This function is exactlly the same than
\textbf{processor(int rk)} but is use in case of blocking communication.

\textbf{processorblock(int rk, mpiComm cc) }: This function is exactlly the same
than \textbf{processor(int rk,mpiComm cc)} but use a synchronization point.



\subsubsection{Points to Points communicators}
In \freefempp you can call MPI points to points communications functions.



\textbf{Send(processor(int rk,mpiComm cc),Data D)} : Blocking send of
\textit{Data D} to processor of \textit{rank rk} inside communicator
\textit{cc}. Note that \textit{Data D} can be: \textit{int, real,complex ,
int[int], real[int],complex[int], Mesh, Mesh3, Matrix}.


\textbf{Recv(processor(int rk,mpiComm cc),Data D)}: Receive \textit{Data D} from
process of rank \textit{rk} in communicator \textit{cc}. Note that \textit{Data
D} can be: \textit{int, real,complex , int[int], real[int],complex[int], Mesh,
Mesh3, Matrix} and should be the same type than corresponding send.


\textbf{Isend(processor(int rk,mpiComm cc),Data D)} : Non blocking send of
\textit{Data D} to processor of \textit{rank rk} inside communicator
\textit{cc}. Note that \textit{Data D} can be: \textit{int, real,complex ,
int[int], real[int],complex[int], Mesh, Mesh3, Matrix}.

\textbf{Recv(processor(int rk,mpiComm cc),Data D)}: Receive corresponding to
send.

\subsubsection{Global operations}

In \freefempp you can call MPI global communication functions.

\textbf{broadcast(processor(int rk,mpiComm cc),Data D)}: Process \textit{rk}
Broadcast \textit{Data D} to all process inside \textit{communicator cc}. Note
that \textit{Data D} can be: \textit{int, real,complex , int[int],

\textbf{mpiAlltoall(Data a,Data b)}: Sends \textit{data a} from all to all
processes. Receive buffer is \textit{Data b}. This is done inside communicator
MPI\_COMM\_WORLD.\\


\textbf{mpiAlltoall(Data a,Data b, mpiComm cc)}: Sends \textit{data a} from all

values  \textit{Data a}  from a group of processes. Process of rank \textit{rk}
get data on communicator \textit{rk}.  This function is like MPI\_Gather\\


\textbf{mpiAllgather(Data a,Data b)} : Gathers \textit{Data a} from all
processes and distribute it to all in \textit{Data b}. This is done inside
communicator MPI\_COMM\_WORLD. This function is like MPI\_Allgather\\

\textbf{mpiAllgather(Data a,Data b, mpiComm cc)} : Gathers \textit{Data a} from
all processes and distribute it to all in \textit{Data b}. This is done inside

\textbf{mpiScatter(Data a,Data b,processor(int rk, mpiComm cc))} : Sends
\textbf{Data a} from one process whith rank \textbf{rk} to all other processes
in group represented by communicator  \textit{mpiComm cc}.\\

\textbf{mpiReduce(Data a,Data b,processor(int rk, mpiComm cc),MPI\_Op op), }

 \textit{mpiPROD}, \textit{mpiLAND}, \textit{mpiLOR}, \textit{mpiLXOR},
\textit{mpiBAND},
 \textit{mpiBXOR}, \textit{mpiMAXLOC}, \textit{mpiMINLOC}.

Note that, for all global operations, only int[int] and real[int] are data type
take in account in \freefempp.

The following example present in details of Schwartz domain decomposition

of parallelism to solve simple Laplacian2d in square domain. We have few number
of subdomain and in every subdomain we use parallel sparse solver to solve local problem.

\section{Dynamical link}
\label{Dynamical link}
Now, it's possible to add built-in functionnalites in \texttt{FreeFem++} under the three
environnents Linux, Windows and MacOS X 10.3 or newer.
It is agood idea to,
first try the example \texttt{load.edp} in directory \texttt{example++-load}.

You will need to install a \texttt{c++} compiler  (generally \texttt{g++/gcc} compiler)
 to compile your function.


\begin{description}
\item[Windows] Install the \texttt{cygwin} environnent or the \texttt{mingw}
\item[MacOs] Install the developer tools xcode on the apple DVD
\item[Linux/Unix] Install the correct compiler  (gcc for instance)
\end{description}

Now, assume  that you are in a shell window (a cygwin window under Windows)  in the directory
\texttt{example++-load}. Remark that  in the sub directory \texttt{include}
they are all the \texttt{FreeFem++} include file to make the link with \texttt{FreeFem++}.



\begin{note}
  If you try to load dynamically a file with command \texttt{load "xxx"}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Under unix (Linux or MacOs), the file \texttt{xxx.so}  twill be loaded so it must be either
 in the search directory of routine \texttt{dlopen}
  (see the environment variable  \verb.$LD_LIBRARY_PATH. or in
  the current directory, and the suffix \texttt{".so"} or the prefix \texttt{"./"} is automatically added.

  \item   Under Windows,
  The file \texttt{xxx.dll}  will be loaded so it must be in
  the \texttt{loadLibary} search directory which includes the directory of the application,
 \end{itemize}
\end{note}

{\bf The compilation of your module}:
the script \texttt{ff-c++} compiles and makes
the link with \texttt{FreeFem++}, but be careful, the script
has no way to known if you try to compile for a
pure Windows environment or for a cygwin environment
so to build the load module under cygwin  you must add
the \texttt{-cygwin} parameter.
%}}}}

\subsection{A first example myfunction.cpp}

The following  defines a new function call \texttt{myfunction} with no parameter, but using the $x,y$ current value.


\bFF
#include  <iostream>
#include  <cfloat>
using namespace std;
#include "error.hpp"
#include "AFunction.hpp"
#include "rgraph.hpp"
#include "RNM.hpp"
#include "fem.hpp"
#include "FESpace.hpp"
#include "MeshPoint.hpp"

@using @namespace Fem2D;
@double myfunction(Stack stack)
{
  //  to get FreeFem++  data
  MeshPoint &mp= *MeshPointStack(stack); // the struct to get x,y, normal , value
  @double x= mp.P.x; // get the current x value
  @double y= mp.P.y; // get the current y value
  //  cout << "x = " << x << " y=" << y << endl;
  @return sin(x)*cos(y);
}
\eFF
Now the Problem is to build the link with \texttt{FreeFem++}, to do that
we need two classes, one to call the function \texttt{myfunction}

All \texttt{FreeFem++} evaluable expression must be a struct/class  \texttt{C++}  which
derive from \texttt{E\_F0}. By default this expression does not depend of the mesh position,
but if they   derive from \texttt{E\_F0mps} the expression depends of the mesh position,
and for more details see \cite{FHcpp}.



\bFF
//  A class build the link with \texttt{FreeFem++}
// generaly this class are already in AFunction.hpp
// but unfortunatly, I have no simple function with no parameter
// in \texttt{FreeFem++} depending of the mesh,
@template<class R>
@class  OneOperator0s : @public OneOperator {

  // the class to defined a evaluated a new function
  //  It  must devive from  E\_F0 if it is mesh independent
  //   or from E\_F0mps if it is mesh dependent
  @class E_F0_F :public  E_F0mps { public:
    @typedef  R (*func)(Stack stack) ;
    func f; // the pointeur to the fnction myfunction
    E_F0_F(func ff)  : f(ff) {}
    // the operator evaluation in \texttt{FreeFem++}
    AnyType @operator()(Stack stack)  @const {@return SetAny<R>( f(stack)) ;}

  };

  @typedef  R (*func)(Stack ) ;
  func  f;
@public:
  // the function which build the \texttt{FreeFem++} byte code
  E_F0 * code(@const basicAC_F0 & ) @const { @return  new E_F0_F(f);}
  // the constructor to say ff is a function without parameter
  // and returning a R
  OneOperator0s(func  ff): OneOperator(map_type[typeid(R).name()]),f(ff){}
};
\eFF


 To finish we must add this new function in \texttt{FreeFem++} table ,
 to do that include :
 
\bFF
@void init(){
  Global.Add("myfunction","(",new OneOperator0s<double>(myfunction));
}
@LOADFUNC(init);
\eFF

It will be called automatically at load module time.

\medskip

To compile and link, use the \texttt{ff-c++} script :
\bFF
% ff-c++ myfunction.cpp
g++ -c -g -Iinclude myfunction.cpp
g++ -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup -g myfunction.o -o ./myfunction.dylib
\eFF
To,  try the simple example under Linux or MacOS, do

\subsection{Example: Discrete Fast Fourier Transform } \index{DFFT}\index{FFT}

This will add FFT to \texttt{FreeFem++}, taken from
 \url{http://www.fftw.org/}. To download and install under \texttt{download/include}
 just go in \texttt{download/fftw} and try\texttt{make}.

 \medskip
 The 1D dfft (fast discret fourier transform)  for a  simple array  $f$ of size $n$
 is defined by the following formula
 $$
    \mathtt{dfft}(f,\varepsilon)_{k} = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} f_i e^{\varepsilon  2\pi i kj/n}
 $$

 The 2D DFFT for an array of size $N=n\times m$ is
$$   \mathtt{dfft}(f,m,\varepsilon)_{k+nl} = \sum_{j'=0}^{m-1} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} f_{i+nj} e^{\varepsilon  2\pi i (kj/n+lj'/m) }
 $$
 Remark: the value  $n$ is given  by $ size(f)/m$, and the numbering is  row-major order.


 So the classical discrete DFFT is  $\hat{f}=\mathtt{dfft}(f,-1)/\sqrt{n}$ and the
 reverse dFFT  $f=\mathtt{dfft}(\hat{f},1)/\sqrt{n}$

 \medskip

 Remark: the 2D Laplace operator is
 $$ f(x,y) = 1/\sqrt{N}  \sum_{j'=0}^{m-1} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \hat{f}_{i+nj} e^{\varepsilon  2\pi i (x j+ yj') } $$
 and we have
 $$ f_{k+nl} = f(k/n,l/m)$$


 So
 $$
     \widehat{\Delta f_{kl}} = -(  (2\pi)^2 ( (\tilde{k})^2+(\tilde{l})^2)) \widehat{ f_{kl}} \\
 $$
 where $ \tilde{k} = k $ if $ k \leq n/2 $ else $ \tilde{k} = k-n$ and
 $ \tilde{l} = l $ if $ l \leq m/2 $ else $ \tilde{l} = l-m$.

 And to have a real function we need all  modes to be symmetric around zero, so $n$ and $m$
 must be odd.

\subsection{More on Adding a new finite element}

First read the section \ref{AddnewFE} of the appendix, we add two
new finite elements examples in the directory \texttt{examples++-load}.

\paragraph{The Bernardi-Raugel Element}
 The Bernardi-Raugel finite element is meant to solve the Navier Stokes equations in
 $ u,p$ formulation;  the velocity space $P^{br}_K$ is minimal to prove the inf-sup condition
 with piecewise constant pressure by triangle.

 The finite element space $V_h$ is
 $$V_h= \{u\in H^1(\Omega)^2 ; \quad \forall K \in T_h,  u_{|K} \in P^{br}_K \} $$
 where
 $$ P^{br}_K = span \{ \lambda^K_i e_k \}_{i=1,2,3, k= 1,2} \cup \{  \lambda^K_i\lambda^K_{i+1} n^K_{i+2}\}_{i=1,2,3} $$
 with notation $4=1, 5=2$ and where
 $\lambda^K_i$ are the barycentric coordinates of the triangle $K$, $(e_k)_{k=1,2}$ the canonical basis  of $\R^2$
 and $n^K_k$ the outer  normal of triangle $K$ opposite to vertex $k$.

 A way to check the finite element

 \bFF
@load "BernadiRaugel"
// a macro the compute numerical derivative
@macro DD(f,hx,hy) ( (f(x1+hx,y1+hy)-f(x1-hx,y1-hy))/(2*(hx+hy))) //
@mesh Th=@square(1,1,[10*(x+y/3),10*(y-x/3)]);

@real x1=0.7,y1=0.9, h=1e-7;
@int it1=Th(x1,y1).nuTriangle;

@fespace Vh(Th,P2BR);

Vh [a1,a2],[b1,b2],[c1,c2];


@for (int i=0;i<Vh.ndofK;++i)
	cout << i << " " << Vh(0,i) << endl;
@for (int i=0;i<Vh.ndofK;++i)
{
  a1[]=0;	
  @int j=Vh(it1,i);
  a1[][j]=1; // a bascis functions
  @plot([a1,a2], wait=1);

  [b1,b2]=[a1,a2]; // do the interpolation

  c1[] = a1[] - b1[];

  @assert( abs(dy(a2)(x1,y1)-DD(a2,0,h) ) < 1e-5);

}
 \eFF

 A real example using this finite element, just a small modification
 of the \texttt{NSP2P1.edp} examples, just the begenning is change to
\bFF
@load "BernadiRaugel"

@real s0=clock();
@mesh Th=square(10,10);
@fespace Vh2(Th,P2BR);
@fespace Vh(Th,P0);
Vh2 [u1,u2],[up1,up2];
Vh2 [v1,v2];
\eFF

And the plot instruction is also changed  because the pressure is constant, and  we cannot  plot isovalues of peacewise constant functions.

\paragraph{The Morley Element}
See the example \texttt{bilapMorley.edp}.

\subsection{Add a new sparse solver}
Warning the sparse solver interface as been completely rewritten in version 3.2 ,
so the section is obsolete, the example in are correct/

Only a fast sketch of the code is given here; for details see the .cpp code
from \texttt{SuperLU.cpp} or \texttt{NewSolve.cpp}.

First the include files:
\bFF
#@include  <iostream>
@using @namespace std;

#@include "rgraph.hpp"
#@include "error.hpp"
#@include "AFunction.hpp"

//#include "lex.hpp"
#@include "MatriceCreuse_tpl.hpp"
#@include "slu_ddefs.h"
#@include "slu_zdefs.h"
\eFF


A small template driver
to unified the \texttt{double} and \texttt{Complex} version.
\bFF
@template <class R> @struct SuperLUDriver
{

};


@template <> @struct SuperLUDriver<@double>
{
  ....  @double version
};

@template <> @struct SuperLUDriver<@Complex>
{
....  @Complex version
};

\eFF

To get  Matrix value, we have just to remark that  the Morse Matrice the storage,
is  the   \texttt{SLU\_NR} format is the compressed row storage, this is
the transpose of the compressed column storage.

\index{m}
\index{n}
\index{nbcoef}
So if \texttt{AA} is a MatriceMorse you have with SuperLU notation.
\bFF
     n=AA.n;
     m=AA.m;
     nnz=AA.nbcoef;
     a=AA.a;
     asub=AA.cl;
     xa=AA.lg;
     options.Trans = TRANS;

     Dtype_t R_SLU = SuperLUDriver<R>::R_SLU_T();
     Create_CompCol_Matrix(&A, m, n, nnz, a, asub, xa, SLU_NC, R_SLU, SLU_GE);
\eFF

To get vector infomation, to solver the linear solver
$ x = A^{-1} b $	
\bFF
   @void Solver(@const MatriceMorse<R> &AA,KN_<R> &x,@const KN_<R> &b) @const
 {
 ....
    Create_Dense_Matrix(&B, m, 1, b, m, SLU_DN, R_SLU, SLU_GE);
    Create_Dense_Matrix(&X, m, 1, x, m, SLU_DN, R_SLU, SLU_GE);
 ....
 }
\eFF

The two \texttt{BuildSolverSuperLU} function, to change the default
sparse solver variable

\ttCC{DefSparseSolver<@double>::solver }

\bFF
MatriceMorse<double>::VirtualSolver *
BuildSolverSuperLU(DCL_ARG_SPARSE_SOLVER(double,A))
{
    @if(verbosity>9)
    @cout << " BuildSolverSuperLU<double>" << endl;
    @return new SolveSuperLU<double>(*A,ds.strategy,ds.tgv,ds.epsilon,ds.tol_pivot,ds.tol_pivot_sym,ds.sparams,ds.perm_r,ds.perm_c);
}

MatriceMorse<Complex>::VirtualSolver *
BuildSolverSuperLU(DCL_ARG_SPARSE_SOLVER(Complex,A))
{
  @if(verbosity>9)
    @cout << " BuildSolverSuperLU<Complex>" << endl;
  @return new SolveSuperLU<Complex>(*A,ds.strategy,ds.tgv,ds.epsilon,ds.tol_pivot,ds.tol_pivot_sym,ds.sparams,ds.perm_r,ds.perm_c);
}


\eFF

The link to \texttt{FreeFem++}


\bFF
@class Init { @public:
    Init();
};
\bFF
  To set the  2 default sparse solver double and complex:
\eFF
DefSparseSolver<@double>::SparseMatSolver SparseMatSolver_R ; ;
DefSparseSolver<Complex>::SparseMatSolver SparseMatSolver_C;
\eFF

To save  the default solver type

\bFF
TypeSolveMat::TSolveMat  TypeSolveMatdefaultvalue=TypeSolveMat::defaultvalue;
\eFF

To reset to the default solver, call this function:
\bFF
@bool SetDefault()
{
   @if(verbosity>1)
	  @cout << " SetDefault sparse to default" << endl;
    DefSparseSolver<@double>::solver =SparseMatSolver_R;
    DefSparseSolver<Complex>::solver =SparseMatSolver_C;
    TypeSolveMat::defaultvalue =TypeSolveMat::SparseSolver;
}
\eFF

To set the default solver to superLU, call this function:
\bFF
@bool SetSuperLU()
{
    @if(verbosity>1)
	  @cout << " SetDefault sparse solver to SuperLU" << endl;
    DefSparseSolver<@double>::solver  =BuildSolverSuperLU;
    DefSparseSolver<Complex>::solver =BuildSolverSuperLU;
    TypeSolveMat::defaultvalue =TypeSolveMatdefaultvalue;
}
\eFF

\index{defaultsolver}
\index{defaulttoSuperLU}
To add new function/name \texttt{defaultsolver,defaulttoSuperLU}in \texttt{freefem++},
and set the default  solver to the new solver., just do:

\bFF
void init()
{

  SparseMatSolver_R= DefSparseSolver<@double>::solver;
  SparseMatSolver_C= DefSparseSolver<@Complex>::solver;

  @if(verbosity>1)
    @cout << "\n Add: SuperLU,  defaultsolver defaultsolverSuperLU" << endl;
  TypeSolveMat::defaultvalue=TypeSolveMat::SparseSolver;
  DefSparseSolver<@double>::solver =BuildSolverSuperLU;
  DefSparseSolver<@Complex>::solver =BuildSolverSuperLU;
  //  test if the name "defaultsolver" exist in freefem++
 @if(! Global.Find("defaultsolver").NotNull() )
    Global.Add("defaultsolver","(",new OneOperator0<bool>(SetDefault));
  Global.Add("defaulttoSuperLU","(",new OneOperator0<bool>(SetSuperLU));
}

LOADFUNC(init);

\eFF

To compile superlu.cpp, just do:

\begin{enumerate}
\item download the SuperLu 3.0 package and do
\begin{verbatim}
curl   http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/superlu_3.0.tar.gz  -o superlu_3.0.tar.gz
tar xvfz superlu_3.0.tar.gz
go SuperLU_3.0 directory
$EDITOR  make.inc
make
\end{verbatim}

\item  In directoy include do
to have a correct version of \texttt{SuperLu} header due to mistake
in case of inclusion of \ttCC{double} and \ttCC{Complex} version in the same file.
\begin{verbatim}
tar xvfz ../SuperLU_3.0-include-ff.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}
I will give a correct one
to compile with freefm++.

To compile  the freefem++ load file  of SuperLu with freefem do:
some find like :
\begin{verbatim}
ff-c++ SuperLU.cpp  -L$HOME/work/LinearSolver/SuperLU_3.0/ -lsuperlu_3.0
\end{verbatim}

And to test the simple example:

\index{defaulttoGMRES}

@for(int i=0;i<3;++i)
{
// if i == 0 then SuperLu  solver \hfilll
//    i == 1 then GMRES    solver \hfilll

which may be redistributed under the terms of the
 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999


		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

\textbf{Book Description}
\medskip

Fruit of a long maturing process freefem, in its last avatar, \texttt{FreeFem++}, is a high level integrated development environment (IDE)  for partial differential equations (PDE).  It is the ideal tool for teaching the finite element method but it is also perfect for research to quickly test new ideas or multi-physics and complex applications.
\medskip

\texttt{FreeFem++} has an advanced automatic mesh generator, capable of a posteriori mesh adaptation; it has a general purpose elliptic solver  interfaced with fast algorithms such as the multi-frontal method UMFPACK. Hyperbolic and parabolic problems are solved by iterative algorithms prescribed by the user with the high level language of \texttt{FreeFem++}. It has several triangular  finite elements, including discontinuous elements.  Finally everything is there in \texttt{FreeFem++} to prepare research quality reports: color display online with zooming and other features and postscript printouts.

\medskip
This book is ideal for students at Master level, for  researchers at any level and for engineers also in financial mathematics.
