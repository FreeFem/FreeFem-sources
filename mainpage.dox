  \section broadview Broad View

  A FreeFem++ script is first translated into a tree of expressions of type CListOfInst (the language grammar is defined
  in \ref language) and then evaluated by calling CListOfInst::eval(). Any resulting graphical data is converted into a
  stream of bytes by the PlotStream class before being sent to the ffglut program (see ffglut.cpp) via a pipe.

  \section details Detailed Program Start Sequence

  - The C++ main() function is part of platform-dependent treatments. It calls mymain() (in lg.ypp) from:

    - Unix: src/Graphics/sansrgraph.cpp
    - Windows: src/Graphics/Pcrgraph.cpp
    - MacOS: src/Graphics/macrgraf.cpp

  - in lg.ypp:

    - mymain() calls mainff(), which calls Compile(), which calls the standard yyparse() function.

    - yyparse() scans the EDP script thanks to the lexer #mylex and generates objects of type YYSTYPE according to the
      grammar described in lg.ypp.

    - When the "start" symbol is successfully scanned, yylval (of type YYSTYPE) contains the whole tree of expressions
    as an object of type CListOfInst. CListOfInst::eval() is called (with one #Stack argument built by #newStack()) to
    run the script.

  \section language FreeFem++-specific Language Elements

  - <b>Types</b> <!-- [[file:src/lglib/lg.ypp::type_of_dcl]] --> can be:
    - a lexical element of reference yytokentype #TYPE defined by calling mylex::Add(Key,aType)
    - a TypeArray
    - a TypeTemplate

  - <b>Variables</b> <!-- [[file:src/lglib/lg.ypp::declaration]] --> are created with Block::NewVar<#LocalVariable >()
  or Block::NewVar<#LocalVariableFES>() which calls TableOfIdentifier::NewVar() and returns a variable reference of type
  C_F0

  - An \b fespace <!-- [[file:src/lglib/lg.ypp::fespace_def]] -->

  currentblock->NewVar<LocalVariableFES,size_t>($1,typeFESpace($3),$3,dimFESpaceImage($3));

    - an id reference previously built with new ListOfId()
    - an expression of type C_F0 describing the type of fespace, obtained with ::Find($1)
    - #atype< #FE<double,2> **>()
    - FE
