  \section broadview Broad View

  A FreeFem++ script is first translated into a tree of expressions of type CListOfInst (the language grammar is defined
  in lg.ypp) and then evaluated by calling CListOfInst::eval(). Any resulting graphical data is converted into a stream
  of bytes by the PlotStream class before being sent to the ffglut program (see ffglut.cpp) via a pipe.

  \section details Detailed Program Start Sequence

  - The C++ main() function is part of platform-dependent treatments. It calls mymain() (in lg.ypp) from:

    - Unix: src/Graphics/sansrgraph.cpp
    - Windows: src/Graphics/Pcrgraph.cpp
    - MacOS: src/Graphics/macrgraf.cpp

  - in lg.ypp:

    - mymain() calls mainff(), which calls Compile(), which calls the standard yyparse() function.

    - yyparse() scans the EDP script thanks to the lexer #mylex. When the "start" symbol is successfully scanned, yylval
    (of type YYSTYPE) contains the whole tree of expressions as an object of type CListOfInst. CListOfInst::eval() is
    called (with one #Stack argument built by #newStack()) to run the script.
