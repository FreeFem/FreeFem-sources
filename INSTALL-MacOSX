To install FreeFem++ on your mac you need to run (double click on) the shell script Install-MacOS.command
(you will need to type your password and you must be "administrator" of your machine).

This script installs FreeFem++, ffglut, ffmedit in /usr/local/bin ,
as well as some possibly missing libraries  and the FreeFem.app in /Applications. 

This version can be used in 3 modes

	- Like a Mac application with drap and drop, etc; then it opens
	  a terminal window for the console IO and (when needed) a graphic window
	  which accepts keyboard commands when in wait mode (listed by typing a "?").

	- In terminal mode: (only when FreeFem++.app has not been moved out of the/ Applications
	directory). In the terminal window one must type "FreeFem++ <filename>" where <filename>
	is the name of your xxx.edp file.
	
	- With the latest version of the smultron.app (http://tuppis.com/smultron/) text editor
	directly from inside the editor by typing "cmd+r". Smultron recognizes xx.edp files and 
	activates a color highlight of the keywords (don't forget a "cmd+s" before the "cmd+r").

 
Technical Note:
-------------
This will not work on MacOs systems less than 10.3.

ffglut     the graphic visalisator
ffmedit    the medit sofware
