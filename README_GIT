The main difference with the previous CVS setup or mercurail  is that every working
copy of FreeFem++ contains a complete git database of all source
files (in a subdirectory called '.git').

* Creating a local copy of the FreeFem++ repository
** from the web in directory ff-git 
   git clone https://github.com/FreeFem/FreeFem-sources ff-git

** create the ~/.gitconfig   file  for commit like: 
[user] (change to your own name)
	name = Frederic Hecht
	email = frederic.hecht@upmc.fr
[push]
	default = simple


* Working with a repository

  All the commands below should be run from a directory of the current
  working copy.

** Adding a file
   git add filename
** Deleting a file
   git rm filename
** Deleting a file only from the Git repository    
   git rm --cached  filenaem
** Commiting all local changes to the local repository
   git commit -a -m "description of changes"
** Checking if there are some uncommitted local changes
   git  status

* Exchanging changes with other repositories
** Pulling changes from another (readable) repository

** Pushing changes into another (writable) repository branch 
  git push origin master
  change master to whatever branch you want to push your changes to. 
  
  repository to a remote server, you need to add it with
  git remote add origin <server>

** create a new branch named "feature_x" and switch to it using
     git checkout -b feature_x
**  switch back to master
     git checkout master	 
    and delete the branch again
     git branch -d feature_x	
**  a branch is not available to others unless you push the branch to your 
    git push origin <branch>


see http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ for  a basic  guide	


Developers that are not part of the official FreeFem team can fork the FreeFem-sources repository on their GitHub account, make modifications locally and submit a pull request to the FreeFem-sources repository


* Compile FreeFem++ 
** first to restore build file.use (automake  > 1.13) 
   autoreconf -i 
 * or extract  build with 
   tar zxvf AutoGeneratedFile.tar.gz 
** build makefile and compilte all third part library
   ./configure --enable-download
 * and  compile petsc/slepc  if need (more than 30 mn) not mandatory
   cd download/ff-petsc
   make petsc-slepc SUDO=sudo (if need root access to install dir)
   make petsc-slepc
   ./configure --enable-download
 * of for a basic version with no downlad 
   ./configure 
** to build 
   make 
** to check (warning some test fail )
make check
** install
   sudo make install 
 * or
   make install
