The main difference with the previous CVS setup is that every working
copy of FreeFem++ contains a complete git database of all source
files (in a subdirectory called '.git').

* Creating a local copy of the FreeFem++ repository
** from the web in directory ff-git 
   git clone https://github.com/FreeFem/FreeFem-sources ff-git

** create the ~/.gitconfig   file  for commit like: 
[user]
	name = Frederic Hecht
	email = frederic.hecht@upmc.fr
[push]
	default = simple


* Working with a repository

  All the commands below should be run from a directory of the current
  working copy.

** Adding a file
   git add filename
** Deleting a file
   hg remove filename
** Commiting all local changes to the local repository
   git commit -m "description of changes"
** Checking if there are some uncommitted local changes
   hg status

* Exchanging changes with other repositories
** Pulling changes from another (readable) repository

** Pushing changes into another (writable) repository branch 
  git push origin master
  change master to whatever branch you want to push your changes to. 
  
  repository to a remote server, you need to add it with
  git remote add origin <server>

** create a new branch named "feature_x" and switch to it using
     git checkout -b feature_x
   switch back to master
     git checkout master	 
   and delete the branch again
     git branch -d feature_x	
  a branch is not available to others unless you push the branch to your 
    git push origin <branch>


see http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ for  a guide	


* Compile FreeFem++ 
** first to restore build file.use (automake  > 1.13) 
 autoreconf -i 
** or extract  build with 
 tar zxvf AutoGeneratedFile.tar.gz 
** build makefies
./configure --enable-download
** to build 
make 
** to check (warning some test fail )
make check
