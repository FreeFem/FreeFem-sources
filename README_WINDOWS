How to compile FreeFem++ on Microsoft Windows
---------------------------------------------

1) Download and install Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com. Make sure
that the development tools Automake, Autoconf and GNU C++ , C , g77 are
installed.

2) Download and extract the FreeFem++ source archive from
http://www.freefem.org

3) Open a Cygwin bash shell and follow the instructions from the
FreeFem++ INSTALL and README files.

Precompiled BLAS libraries
--------------------------

Precompiled ATLAS libraries are available at
http://www.netlib.org/atlas/archives/windows/. There are several
processor type dependant libraries to choose from. If FreeFem++ is
configured with the options "--enable-generic" and
"--enable-download", it will download the most generic version. Or you
can download a more optimized version and specify it to "./configure"
with the option "--with-blas=..." (see README).

Creating a Windows package
--------------------------

To create a Microsoft Windows self-installable package containing
FreeFem++ executables, examples and documentation, you need to install
"Inno Setup" (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) on your machine
first. Then run "make WindowsPackage.iss" and load the file
"WindowsPackage.iss" into Inno Setup once you have configured and
compiled FreeFem++ (see INSTALL). Inno Setup places the resulting
archive in subdirectory "Output".

TROUBLE:
--------

Infortunatly, all the .exe version without cygwin under  mingw
do not run under cygwin shell,  they run under under the 
command window NT  shell if the mingwm10.dll is in the right place:
.exe directory or in 'C:\WINDOW\system32. 

In version 2.0
BUG in LAPACK with -O optim flag
the file ARPACK/LAPACK/dlamch.f 
symptome: the code loop.
correct the Makefile.m4 to

inforce the compilation flag

REMARK:
All the exe and .dll are in 
src/bin-win32 

To build the install program you must get inno Setup 5 sofware
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
and the the cygwin package tex, pdflatex, ImageMagick , ghostscript 


make WindowsPackage.iss
make documentation

to build the setup file, use  inno setup on file WindowsPackage.iss
the setup file is in output directory

The compilation flag use to build the version

for a P4 compile on petium-m vaio VGN-S2XP
./configure '--enable-optim' '--enable-download' '--with-suffix=P4'
for the generic :
./configure '--enable-download' '--enable-generic' '--enable-optim' '--with-blas=/home/UNIVERSITE/blas/generic-no-cygwin-blas.dll' 'CPPFLAGS=-I/home/UNIVERSITE/blas/'
