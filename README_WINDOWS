How to compile FreeFem++ on Microsoft Windows
---------------------------------------------

1) Download and install Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com. Make sure
that the development tools Automake, Autoconf and GNU C++ are
installed.

2) Download and extract the FreeFem++ source archive from
http://www.freefem.org

3) Open a Cygwin bash shell and follow the instructions from the
FreeFem++ INSTALL and README files.

Precompiled BLAS libraries
--------------------------

Precompiled ATLAS libraries are available at
http://www.netlib.org/atlas/archives/windows/. There are several
processor type dependant libraries to choose from. If FreeFem++ is
configured with the options "--enable-generic" and
"--enable-download", it will download the most generic version. Or you
can download a more optimized version and specify it to "./configure"
with the option "--with-blas=..." (see README).
