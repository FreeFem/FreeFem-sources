Compilation of FreeFem++ under unix, MacOs 10 or cygwin (Window)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This file details specific configuration details for FreeFem++. For
a standard installation, please refer to the file named "INSTALL".

Debugging and optimization
--------------------------

Without any option, "./configure" selects the best optimization
options for the local machine. To produce optimized binaries that can
be ported to other machines, add the option "--enable-generic".

To produce FreeFem++ programs containing debugging symbols and no
optimization, use "--enable-debug".

If you need to add specific flags to the ones that ./configure
chooses, just define the corresponding automake variable before
running configure. For instance, to add flag "-x" to C++ compilations,
say:

> CXXFLAGS=-x ./configure

Other useful configuration variables include:
- CFLAGS for C compilation
- FFLAGS for Fortran compilation
- LIBS libraries for the linking stage
- LDFLAGS linking flags
- LDADD extra options for the linking stage

Linear algebra libraries and eigen value problem
-----------------------------------------------


By default, "./configure" looks for the BLAS, ARPACK and UMFPACK
libraries on the local system.
ARPACK is use to compute eigenvalue.
and UMFPACK is a new fast sparce linear solver.


 If configure cannot find the libraries
by itself, you can specify the full path to a library file (ending
with ".a") or the options use by the linker (ex: "-L/usr/local/lib -lblas")
with the following options:

--with-blas="blas linker options"  
--with-arpack="arpack linker options"
--with-amd="amd linker options"
--with-umfpack="umfpack linker options"

Or, if the configuration flag "--enable-download" is specified, the
compilation step ("make") will try to download the missing libraries
(from their official websites) and compile them.

Remark, under linux or window the simplest way to get
a not to bad version is
./configure --enable download --enable-generic_blas

Here are the different versions of FreeFem++ produced by one
compilation (some versions may be missing if your system does not
support them):OA

* FreeFem++: standard version (using X11 graphics on Linux and MacOS
  10, Win32 on Windows and  MacOS X) (located in src/std)

* FreeFem++-nw: without graphics (located in src/nw)

* FreeFem++-glx: graphics based on OpenGL (located in src/glx)

* FreeFem++-agl: graphics based on MacOS X CoCoa (located in src/agl)

* FreeFem++-mpi: parallel version, without graphics (located in src/mpi)

The compilation procedure (produced with automake) builds all the
libraries and executables sequentially. Running "make" in a
subdirectory does not rebuild dependencies in other directories.

The compilation has been tested under linux and MacOs/Darwin with g++
version 2.95.2, 2.95.3, 3.01 3.1 3.3. It take 30 mn to compile all on
my PowerBook G4 1Mhz 1024MB.

Rebuilding "./configure"
------------------------

Developers of FreeFem++ can rebuild the configuration system using
Automake and Autoconf with the command:

> autoreconf

Extra utilities
---------------

To run an interactive test of FreeFem++:
> make visualcheck

To run a speed test:
> make speedtest

To create the documentation in .ps and .pdf format (in the "DOC" directory):
> make documentation

Examples
--------

All the Examples are in the two directories examples++ and
examples++-tutorial. The suffix is .edp ("equations aux derivees
partielles" in French)

To test all the examples under unix: 

> cd examples++; ../src/std/FreeFem++ all.edp
> cd examples++-tutorial; ../src/std/FreeFem++ all.edp

To try the  dynamic linking loader example:
> cd example++-load
> ./load.link myfunction 
> g++ -c -I../src/fflib -I../src/femlib -I../src/Graphics myfunction.cpp
> g++ -shared myfunction.o -o myfunction.so
> ../src/nw/FreeFem++-nw load.edp

Note 1: if this does not work, please check the manual page of dlopen
for your system.

Note 2: on MacOSX, link problems occur because of some incompatibility
between RTTI, templates and the apple c++ version (2.95.2). But this
is now working with the new g++3 compiler (default compiler in MacOs
10.2) and also with g++-3.3.
