How to adapt ARPACK for compilation with FreeFem++
--------------------------------------------------
the simplest  way is just 
configure --enable-download 
--------------------------------------------------
Or to compile arpack by hand  hard to explain:

just to remark:
Pass the patch  to compile on g++ 3.x 
http://www.gdv.uni-hannover.de/~reuter/software.php

Remark, they are in arpack and arpack++ a lot  of incoherance.
The last one is in lapack lib second.f in an function not a procedure like in arpack.
Two weeks work to find this mistake.
