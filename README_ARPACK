How to adapt ARPACK for compilation with FreeFem++
--------------------------------------------------
the simplest  way is just 
configure --enable-download 
--------------------------------------------------
Or to compile arpack no problem

   Remark, in arpack++ a lot  of incoherance this moderne c++ (g++3 or better)
so I write the driver by hand (from version 3.) no arpack++ in	    
include in freefem++ now. 

The last one is in lapack lib second.f in an function not a procedure like in arpack.
Two weeks work to find this mistake.
