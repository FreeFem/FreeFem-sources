## [4.13]

### Added

- Composite FE spaces and variational forms for coupled problems:

  - can now define composite FE spaces with different meshes/mesh types as
    ```
    fespace Uh(Th1,[P2,P2]);
    fespace Ph(Th2,P1);
    fespace Vh=Uh*Ph;
    ```

    ```
    fespace Uh(Th1,[P2,P2]);
    fespace Ph(Th2,P1);
    Uh [u1,u2],[v1,v2];
    Ph p,q;

    solve Pb (<[u1,u2],[p]>, <[v1,v2],[q]>) = ...
    ```

    see `examples/examples/stokes_composite.edp` and `examples/examples/stokes_periodic_composite.edp`

  meshS Tsl=buildmesh(TL,1,op);// op = 0 Lap and op =1 => minsurf.
- add sparse block to sparse matrix
  matrix A = va(Vh,Vh);
