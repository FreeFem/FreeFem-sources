Description: A PDE oriented language using Finite Element Method
 FreeFem++ is an implementation of a language dedicated to the finite element
 method. It provides you a way to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDE)
 simply.
 .
 Problems involving partial differential equations (pde) of  several branches
 of physics such as fluid-structure interactions require interpolations of data
 on several meshes and their manipulation within one program.
 .
 FreeFem++ is an extension of freefem, freefem+ written in C++.
 .
 This package contains the common files for the different flavors of FreeFem++.
