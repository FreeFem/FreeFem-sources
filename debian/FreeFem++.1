This manual page documents briefly the
.B FreeFem++, 
.B FreeFem++-nw,
.B FreeFem++-glx,
.B FreeFem++-mpi
and 
.B FreeFem++-cs

This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
Instead, it has detailed documentation in the manual; see below.
