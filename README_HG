Using Mercurial for FreeFem++ source files management
-----------------------------------------------------
Antoine Le Hyaric (http://www.ann.jussieu.fr/~lehyaric)

The main difference with the previous CVS setup is that every working
copy of FreeFem++ contains a complete Mercurial database of all source
files (in a subdirectory called '.hg').

* Creating a local copy of the FreeFem++ repository
** from the web
   hg clone http://www.freefem.org/ff++/ff++
** from another local directory
   hg clone /another/local/dir
** from another directory on a remote machine via ssh
   hg clone ssh://myself@remotemachine//another/directory
** create the ~/.hgrc  file  for commit

* Working with a repository

  All the commands below should be run from a directory of the current
  working copy.

** Adding a file
   hg add filename
** Deleting a file
   hg remove filename
** Commiting all local changes to the local repository
   hg commit -m "description of changes"
** Checking if there are some uncommitted local changes
   hg status

* Exchanging changes with other repositories
** Pulling changes from another (readable) repository
  hg pull -u http://www.freefem.org/ff++/ff++
  hg pull -u /another/local/dir
  hg pull -u ssh://myself@remotemachine/remote/directory

** Pushing changes into another (writable) repository
  hg push /another/local/dir
  hg push ssh://myself@remotemachine/another/directory

* Official Mercurial documentation

*  Compile FreeFem++ 
** first to restore build file.use (automake  > 1.13) 
 autoreconf -i 
** or extract  build with 
 tar zxvf AutoGeneratedFile.tar.gz 
** build makefies
./configure --enable-download
** to build 
make 
** to check (warning some test fail )
make check
** install
sudo make install
